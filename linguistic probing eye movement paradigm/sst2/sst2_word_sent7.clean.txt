Hide new secretions from the parental units 
Contains no wit , only labored gags 
That loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature 
Remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout 
On the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s the filmmakers could dredge up 
That 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment 
Demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
Of saucy 
A depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry 
Are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films 
Goes to absurd lengths 
For those moviegoers who complain that ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore 
The part where nothing 's happening , 
Saw how bad this movie was 
Lend some dignity to a dumb story 
The greatest musicians 
Cold movie 
With his usual intelligence and subtlety 
Redundant concept 
Swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
Equals the original and in some ways even betters it 
If anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
A smile on your face 
Comes from the brave , uninhibited performances 
Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic 
Enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits 
Which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening 
In world cinema 
Very good viewing alternative 
The plot is nothing but boilerplate clich��s from start to finish , 
The action is stilted 
On all cylinders 
Will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted 
By far the worst movie of the year 
Sit through , 
More than another `` best man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film 
It 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that 's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline 
Heroes 
Oblivious to the existence of this film 
Sharply 
The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
Sometimes dry 
As they come , already having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
Covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature 
A $ 40 million version of a game 
Gorgeous and deceptively minimalist 
Cross swords with the best of them and 
As a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist 
Proves once again he has n't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
Disappointments 
The horrors 
A muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
Many pointless

Contrived , well-worn situations 
A doa 
Poor ben bratt could n't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
To be as subtle and touching as the son 's room 
Starts with a legend 
Far less sophisticated and 
Rich veins of funny stuff in this movie 
No apparent joy 
Shot on ugly digital video 
... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... the film 's ending has a `` what was it all for ? '' 
Though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie 
Is pretty damned funny . 
We never feel anything for these characters 
's a lousy one at that 
The corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
Of the most highly-praised disappointments i 
Sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
Seem fresh 
To the dustbin of history 
As a director , eastwood is off his game

Weak and

Film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror 
Are an absolute joy 
Generates 
, like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows 
Based on a true and historically significant story 
Well-rounded tribute 
, though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
So much like a young robert deniro 
Khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
Fashioning an engrossing entertainment out 
Spiffy animated feature 
That 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
Alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life 
Strung-together moments 
, generous and subversive artworks 
It does n't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world 
Funny yet 
Overbearing and over-the-top 
It 's robert duvall ! 
Rich and sudden wisdom 
Acted and directed , it 's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him 
In memory 
Respectable new one 
Yet this grating showcase 
Hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles 
Addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history 
, this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
Build some robots , haul 'em to the theater with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year 
Do n't work in concert 
The direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam ` ron seal the deal . 
Would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further 
It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , 
Hawaiian shirt 
Takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
Provide its keenest pleasures 
Altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece 
Grievous but 
After you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
Hopeless 
Unpretentious , charming , quirky , original 
Nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try . 
Very well-written and very well-acted . 
Are n't many conclusive answers in the film 
Clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , 
Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
Bring tissues . 
The film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
Brings the proper conviction to his role as ( jason bourne ) . 
As a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy 
There 's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
Just too silly 
Cinematic bon bons 
It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and 
A lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
Irritates and 
Collapse 
So many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws 
, it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
Wide-awake all the way through 
( vainly , i think ) 
Is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . 
Is effective if you stick with it 
That underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community 
Delivers what it promises : a look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans 
Watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy 
Absolutely and completely ridiculous and 
's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . 
The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
Realistic portrayal 
As if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story 
Well-thought stunts or 
Reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . 
No lika da 
A welcome relief 
The promise of digital filmmaking 
Just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar 
Justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau 
Extraordinary faith 
Have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart 
, sometimes beautiful adaptation 
About as interesting 
Caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
Overlong , and bombastic 
Derivative and hammily 
Most audacious , outrageous , 
At its best moments 
Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
That final , beautiful scene 
Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , 
Eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights 
The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .

Infectiously 
The picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance .

A passable date film 
Imax in short 
I hate it . 
's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men 
No one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting 
In this wildly uneven movie 
Pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license 
Like one of ( spears ' ) music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it 
With color and depth , and rather a good time 
Silly , outrageous , ingenious 
Being able to hit on a 15-year old when you 're over 100 
The story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
The year 's best and most unpredictable comedy 
Starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming 
Men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
Elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
A good one 
, plodding picture 
The character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions 
Lost in the translation this time 
Speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be 
Enables shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb 
A plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 
Inane and awful 
Told in scattered fashion 
Takes chances that are bold by studio standards 
Believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects 
Only thing to fear about `` fear dot com '' 
Whole mess 
Manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor 
Working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli ... ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
A r��sum�� loaded with credits like `` girl in bar # 3

Very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors 
The , yes , snail-like pacing 
An extremely unpleasant film . 
If it is n't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers 
The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ...

Halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it

A fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats .

Making kahlo 's art a living , 
Bad run

Many pleasures 
Is worth searching out 
At this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless 
Time bombs 
Balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . 
The surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations 
Plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
A sour taste in one 's mouth 
Decent performance 
... familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . 
A headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar 's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
Responsible for one of the worst movies of one year 
Appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived 
Movie love 
Human darkness 
Understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself 
It 's too loud to shout insults at the screen 
's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 )

Failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest

Feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans 
No explanation 
Funniest and 
A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be 
Starts off witty and sophisticated and you 
A bargain-basement european pickup 
, but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
Shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished 
Taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults 
Lead a group of talented friends astray 
It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating . 
This gentle , mesmerizing portrait 
Genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , 
Draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss 
Spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) 
Is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own 
It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made ( eyre 's ) first film something of a sleeper success . 
Handles it in the most unexpected way 
Those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . 
Obscenely bad 
Devastatingly 
I do n't see the point 
Comes off like a bad imitation of the bard 
That excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone 
One of its strengths 
Of masterpiece 
Into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto 
Stiff or just plain bad 
Makes these lives count 
Jolts the laughs from the audience -- 
A delightful stimulus 
Has no point 
Of isolation and frustration 
Winning shot 
Of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel 
Feeling guilty for it ... then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .

Bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst 's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy . 
Father clich�� 
Domestic tension and unhappiness 
The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable 
Called the best korean film of 2002 
One of the best rock 
It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves 
Of the holiday box office pie 
Inexpressible and drab wannabe 
The hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit 
Like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story 
's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and 
To hate 
To be mesmerised 
The people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version 
A lot of energy 
For its success on a patient viewer 
While tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
This may be burns 's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen .

Undramatic 
The pile of useless actioners 
Morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
Weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces 
Efficiency and an affection for the period 
Manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it 
Does not work . 
It is n't merely offensive 
Tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in 
It irrigates our souls . 
A hint of humor 
With a big heart 
A rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages 
Its most immediate and most obvious pleasure 
There are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies 
One of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them . 
Made a decent ` intro ' documentary 
Makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
The film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability 
A beyond-lame satire , teddy bears ' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
Emotional seesawing 
Movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid 
Target audience has n't graduated from junior high school 
This intricately structured and well-realized drama 
Embracing 
The film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire 
A meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff .

Moody male hustler 
Uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels 
The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
Which is mostly a bore 
An entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans 
Suspect that you 'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . 
The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
Love this movie 
... the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
Flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community 
Liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances 
Is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
Works smoothly 
With a creepy and dead-on performance 
Might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead . 
Placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers 
A satisfyingly unsettling ride 
Good a job as anyone

The intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- 
Are pretty valuable these days 
( i ) t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .

Of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it 
We find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story

Reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , 
Delivered with such conviction that it 's hard not to be carried away 
Colorful , vibrant introduction 
The slow parade of human frailty fascinates you 
Famuyiwa 's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer . 
A laugh between them 
That gradually sneaks up on the audience 
Photographic marvel 
Is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . 
Gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's hollywood . 
While not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
Wow ' factor 
Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u.s. -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
Brazil-like , hyper-real satire 
Low on both suspense and payoff

An absolute delight for all audiences

Moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution

Revelatory performance 
The pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion

Nifty premise

The wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and

Earnest movie 
Effective enough 
Showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times 
Make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok 
Going at a rapid pace , 
Still fun and enjoyable and 
A lazy exercise in bad filmmaking 
This thing is virtually unwatchable .

Would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out

Likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
Makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult 
A fascinating , compelling story 
The film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence 
A fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction .

A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 
Comedic writing 
Humorous and touching . 
Of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd 
It 's easy to love robin tunney 
I like that smith , he 's not making fun of these people , he 's not laughing at them . 
A guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort 
, the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
More graceful way 
An uninspired preachy and clich��d war film . 
Will turn out 
It 's the worst movie i 've seen this summer 
Perfect material 
One of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio 
( seagal 's ) strenuous attempt at a change in expression 
Gooding is the energetic frontman , and it 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
Promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
Offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending 
In a grisly sort of way 
Nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap 
More frustrating 
Lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse 
There are laughs aplenty , and 
Lifted from terry gilliam 's subconscious , pressed through kafka 's meat grinder and into bu?uel 's casings 
Of sleaziness 
This too-long , spoofy update 
Shoddy male hip hop fantasy 
, cynical 
Like puppies with broken legs 
That should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
Knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers 
Excited about on this dvd 
Just is n't as weird as it ought to be . 
Should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie 
As the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life 
Many of the things that made the first one charming 
As if by cattle prod 
Struggling 
Beautiful paean 
Entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive 
All about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
Begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
Dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better 
Dreadfulness 
It 's not very interesting . 
The film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from hong kong 's versatile stanley kwan . 
A treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller 
Out 
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
An all-around good time at the movies 
Humor in i spy is so anemic . 
The by now intolerable morbidity 
Touched by the film 's conviction 
A spoof comedy 
It would fit chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special . 
Seem tired and , 
One of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed 
Pointed , often tender , examination 
Touching reflection 
A smartly directed , grown-up film 
Help overcome the problematic script . 
Show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty 
This fascinating portrait of a modern lothario 
Put together a bold biographical fantasia 
Slow and ponderous , but rohmer 's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 
As underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
Drowned me 
A movie character more unattractive or odorous ( than leon ) 
Haneke 's script ( from elfriede jelinek 's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
, scoob and shag do n't eat enough during the film . ' 
A screwed-up man 
Rumblings 
An incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture 
Sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart 
Lightweight filmmaking 
And satirical touches 
Is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
A bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood 
Hackneyed concepts 
A heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
Remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) 
A powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year . 
As well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and 
Wickedly undramatic 
A legendary professor 
Is magnetic as graham 
Has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 
Deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
To watch too many barney videos 
Be able to look away for a second 
Heartfelt performances 
A legacy 
An evil , monstrous lunatic 
Smoky and inviting 
The wisdom and humor 
Saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo 
Excruciatingly tedious 
Beyond redemption 
The intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt 
Sleep-inducing 
Coen brothers 
Never rises above mediocrity 
No doubt intended the film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror 
Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look . 
Farts 
A wonderful tale of love and destiny 
The fourth `` pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance . 
've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before 
Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
Hackneyed and meanspirited 
Makes a meal of it 
The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and 
Mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
The unacceptable 
Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
Shockingly bad 
Run of the mill 
Is n't a very 
Most amazing super-sized dosage 
Is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
Spies 
4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , 
Laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser 
The opulent lushness 
( allen ) manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 
The writing and direction to the soggy performances 
Went back 
Unfunny 
Good film 
A simplistic narrative and 
Plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
Finely written 
Attentive 
A canny crowd pleaser , 
Real and amusing 
A dependable concept 
Straight from the saturday morning cartoons 
Least 
Very light 
Thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except 
Dying a slow death 
Some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life 
Lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
Under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic 
Transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest 
Reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality 
To convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them 
Downright intoxicating 
With ` bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . 
Especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand 
Vaporize from your memory minutes 
Energetic 
's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
Decrepit 
Two guys yelling in your face for two hours 
Bloody beauty as vivid 
Cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth 
Is not handled well 
Long and eventful 
, after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers 
Suffocating 
Has considerable charm 
For its extraordinary intelligence and originality 
Stink 
Good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch 
Kids will love its fantasy and adventure 
( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really 
, to my great pleasure , 
One of the most entertaining bonds in years 
In a standard plot 
The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended . 
Been written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit 
B movies 
To address his own world war ii experience in his signature style 
From others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches 
Draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent 
Be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 
For pretentious arts majors 
See a movie with its heart 
Reek of a script 
Bottom tier 
Delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them 
An admirable reconstruction of terrible events 
's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director 
As john ritter 's glory days 
Fights a good fight 
Is god 
Floating narrative 
Stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy 
A screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
Of this dog of a movie 
Too bad kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
Yet depressing film 
Does pack some serious suspense . 
Descends into such message-mongering moralism 
Gripping humanity 
Fall fast asleep 
Virtually no aftertaste 
Inane and unimaginative 
's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , 
Bound 
Self-absorbed 
See the forest for the trees 
's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good 
Intolerable company 
Talky , artificial and opaque 
For one splendidly cast pair 
Underneath such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images 
Falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice . 
Convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons 
Are ... impeccable throughout . 
Driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm ... the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs 
Horror/action hybrid 
Of the finest films of the year 
Lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
That at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch 
Director paul cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky 's diaries is both stimulating and demanding . 
Is too long with too little going on 
Much needed 
Jones and snipes are enthralling 
That this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out 
Participation 
You can smell the grease on the plot 
Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls '' and 
Human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
Still fun and enjoyable 
This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged 
A completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , 
Often overwritten 
To please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies 
Nearly impossible 
Down-to-earth bullock 
Is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
Proves once again he has n't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film 
One-hour mark 
The first bond movie in ages that is n't fake fun 
Not constant bloodshed 
Offers no new insight on the matter 
You can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored 
Overwhelmingly 
Spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick 
Tastelessness and gall 
Bad action-movie line 
Grows 
As it does because ( the leads ) are such a companionable couple 
Contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive 
The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way 
Any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly 
Caliber 
Balanced film 
Of run-of-the-mill profanity 
Feel like three hours . 
Excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone 
Is built on a potentially interesting idea 
Is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be 
Laughably 
Been kind enough to share it 
Of bland hotels , highways , parking lots 
With a large dose of painkillers 
Liked a lot of the smaller scenes 
Wastes 
Continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
, mind-numbingly , indescribably bad 
There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , 
A river of sadness that pours into every frame 
Menacing 
Incessantly 
Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
That you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch 
At existing photos 
Helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , 
As funny nor 
Gangs excels in spectacle and pacing . 
We want the funk - and this movie 's got it 
Creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky 's diaries . 
Devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
Lacks balance 
Hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild 
Revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
Tv 
An entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance . 
Demonstrating vividly 
It 's sweet and fluffy at the time , 
Marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
A powerful , inflammatory film 
Favor of tradition and warmth 
Begins on a high note and 
Has much to recommend it 
A vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition 
A simple tale 
Despicable characters 
` it 's like having an old friend for dinner ' . 
, director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
This amiable picture 
That keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions 
A markedly inactive film 
Saves this deeply affecting film 
Cold , nervy and memorable 
Exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise 
The gratuitous cinematic distractions 
Manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
The interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic 
Insanely hilarious 
Does n't work because there is no foundation for it 
Surprise us 
Relative modesty 
Coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker 
Remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it 's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies . 
, if good-hearted , movie . 
Makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
Inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material 
No pastry is violated 
Is very difficult 
I 'll buy the soundtrack . 
Hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic 
Is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical 
To the genre and another first-rate performance 
An adventurous young talent 
Predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol 
Intricate plot 
, this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
To it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo 
As i laughed throughout the movie 
Impossibly contrived situations 
Fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals 
A moral tale with a twisted sense of humor 
Is the best ` old neighborhood ' project 
Others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
Make italian for beginners worth the journey 
Most good-hearted 
A chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france 
A competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
Poignant and funny 
Thanks to a small star with big heart 
Impersonal and abstract 
It 's a glorious spectacle like those d.w. griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
-- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline 
If you 're a fan of the series you 'll love it and probably want to see it twice . 
It misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
Too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe 
Accents so good 
A classy , sprightly spin on film 
An original 
A thing that already knows it 's won 
As punching bags 
Nothing to sneeze at these days 
Ms. paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona 
Good-natured 
Star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life 
's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen 
Brought to life on the big screen 
An entertaining movie 
Is a very funny , heartwarming film . 
More than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks 
Encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . 
That gets under your skin 
Be half as entertaining as it is 
Turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
A rollicking adventure for you 
That even its target audience talked all the way through it 
Prickly indie comedy 
Halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course 
Ethics 
That rare animal known as ' a perfect family film 
Other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time 
And crude film 
Could n't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
With real world events 
It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
Mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
Sanctimonious , self-righteous and 
It 's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas 
Acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable 
One of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original 
The spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
Is why anybody picked it up . 
Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
Like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok 
Seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick 
That takes itself all too seriously 
With a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast 
Has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
Even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel 
Through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people 
The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre 
The piano teacher is not an easy film . 
Manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar 
Daft by half ... but supremely good natured 
Much power 
Of carnage 
This picture 
Increasingly diverse french director 
Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious 
Features nonsensical and laughable plotting 
Served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick 
's plenty to offend everyone 
Reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans 
Save their children 
That 's old-fashioned in all the best possible ways 
Surprisingly touching 
Come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy 
Worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz 
's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
, the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
An obvious rapport with her actors 
A cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
Existential exploration 
Road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire 
Commercialism all in the same movie ... without neglecting character development for even one minute 
May not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking 
Inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone 
Both shrill and soporific , and because everything 
Sinister 
Than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds 
Aground 
Amazing 
Have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize 
For that comes through all too painfully in the execution 
Open-ended questions 
Like brosnan 's performance 
Counting a few gross-out comedies i 've been trying to forget 
Sense is a movie that deserves recommendation 
The road 
Phrase ` life affirming ' 
An airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe 
Little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
To the film 's music 
And dog lovers 
Moving tale 
No surprises 
Crawls along 
Sure mainstream audiences will be baffled 
Begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is . 
Oddly humorous to tediously sentimental 
Grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration . 
Lonely 
It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent 
There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but 
Has been 
, cry and realize , 
Does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
Told well by a master 
From a ploddingly melodramatic structure 
A show forged in still-raw emotions 
To seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject 
Of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original 
Captivates 
Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
Drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other 
You could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines 
The filling 
It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but 
Angelina jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy 
Queasy-stomached 
The ` ick ' in ` classic 
Very choppy and monosyllabic 
Psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 
Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur 
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and 
Welcome with audiences 
Everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . 
The gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances 
Startling story 
Do with imagination 
Rage 
Dumplings 
More interesting -- and , dare i say , 
Exactly assured in its execution 
'll keep watching the skies for his next project 
As tiresome as 9 
Plot , characters , 
Does not work 
That prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
Seem self-consciously poetic and 
Back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
Has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy 
Authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment 
Satisfying 
Revolutionary spirit 
A crowd-pleaser , but then , 
Anemic , 
A rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place 
Spielberg 's first real masterpiece 
The plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness 
The obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael 's evolution 
Is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
While peppering the pages with memorable zingers 
Falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
, truths emerge . 
Those words 
The film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
By cliches , painful improbability and murky points 
Generous , inspiring film 
Tossed off 
This shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism 
Of more appealing holiday-season product 
Sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special 
A thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle 
Like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place 
Dialogue and sharp 
The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
Graduated 
Nohe 's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible 
Enriched 
To take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience 's meat grinder one more time 
A pretty decent kid-pleasing 
Unrecoverable 
That manages to invest real humor 
Articulate , grown-up voice 
Commercialism all in the same movie 
Nifty 
's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 
A thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions . 
Some delightful work on indie projects 
Making up for any flaws that come later 
Terrific effort 
The courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid 
Xmas 
, it does give exposure to some talented performers 
A cheap scam 
Once one experiences mr. haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else . 
Does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
Falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer 
Paints a grand picture of an era and 
Of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games 
The film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- 
It is a likable story , told with competence . 
Originality is sorely lacking . 
Especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget 
The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
Balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply 
Along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes 
No-nonsense authority 
Idiocy 
Moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
, visually graceful 
Sappiness 
The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came 
Loose 
Looking and stylish 
The three leads produce adequate performances , but 
Drug abuse , infidelity and death are n't usually comedy fare , but turpin 's film allows us to chuckle through the angst 
A beautiful film to watch 
Writer-director david jacobson 
's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand 
Neither romantic nor comedic 
The movie dawdle 
With fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs 
Good-natured and sometimes quite funny 
A complete waste of time 
Largely devoid 
To cheesier to cheesiest 
Piece , a model of menacing atmosphere 
Of last summer 's bloated effects 
A low-budget series on a uhf channel 
Satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time . 
Proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast 
Use a few good laughs 
Someone made off with your wallet 
's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . 
Dodge this one 
This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers ' oeuvre 
Played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman ca n't save it . 
This does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
Benefit enormously from the cockettes ' camera craziness 
In its sparkling beauty 
`` brown sugar '' admirably aspires to be more than another `` best man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
Features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
( gulpilil ) is a commanding screen presence 
Lively 
It seem fresh again 
Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet 
Good guys and 
The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and 
The dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny 
Clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
Cannibal lust above the ordinary 
Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it 
Will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking . 
Feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way 
Spectacularly 
Construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest 
Conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt 
To break the tedium 
The ridiculousness 
Well-done film 
's not that funny 
Inhuman cinematic punishment 
Of its epic scope 
Pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy 
Of heartfelt performances 
Fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema 
Poetic road movie 
Play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen 
There 's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
You 've figured out late marriage 
One of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
Teddy bears ' picnic ranks 
Dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated 
Right place 
Oddly sweet 
A recycled and dumbed-down version of love story 
Pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . 
So second-rate 
An old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they 
A frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley 's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay 
Engaging characters 
, twisted , brilliant and macabre 
A heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse 
Tootsie knockoff . 
Need movies like tim mccann 's revolution no. 9 . 
Britney spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
Unfortunately , that 's precisely what arthur dong 's family fundamentals does . 
Than what 's been cobbled together onscreen 
Deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen 
A wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind 
Expresses our most basic emotions 
For the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
Huge gap 
A very moving and revelatory footnote 
A non-mystery mystery . 
Fascinating -- and timely -- content 
Loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time 
A smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist 
Gut-clutching piece 
Becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
Subjugate truth 
The shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera 
With the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look 
To remember 
Is a real filmmaker 
A great film noir 
This film , which is often preachy and poorly acted 
Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies 
Is that it does n't make any sense 
A talky bore 
Bristles with passion and energy 
A successful career 
Is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop freudianism .

Tear your eyes away 
The sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes 
Dickens ' words 
Satisfying destination 
Arguably the best script that besson has written in years . 
Its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints 
Many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and 
Fun one 
To no particularly memorable effect 
Ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe 
Highly predictable narrative 
Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya 
, you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down 
None-too-original 
Romp that has something to say . 
Zone '' episode 
A stultifyingly obvious one 
, you 'll like promises . 
It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
Turntablism 
Is well worth seeing 
The strain is all too evident 
Unlike 
Upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
Bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera 
Documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
With which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period

Eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
Incessant 
When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , i trust , will you . 
Talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be 
Witless and utterly pointless .

Much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
Missing from the girls ' big-screen blowout 
From charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
The paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final ( restored ) third ... 
Much fun 
In recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot 
Of a poetic 
The most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
Great director 
And , thanks to the presence of ` the king , ' it also rocks . 
His martial artistry 
A little-remembered world 
An authentic feel 
`` sweet home alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ... 
All of dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability 
Not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions 
The smarter offerings 
As the long-faced sad sack 
All the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones 
Playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer 
Director m. night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell 
Negativity 
Does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject -- 
Brian tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky 's excellent music 
's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present 
Steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
Jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , 
A late-inning twist that just does n't make sense 
Is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous 
To shine through the gloomy film noir veil 
Of the year 's most enjoyable releases 
A bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation . 
A delightful , if minor , pastry 
The latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian 
The film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable 
Vulgar , sexist , racist humor 
Offbeat humor 
Finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort 
Viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies 
In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
Enough to give you brain strain 
This bad 
In sham actor workshops and an affected malaise 
Ca n't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops 
Downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness 
A couple hours of summertime

Pleasingly 
A complete mess 
So perfect

Cutting hollywood satire 
Directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them 
This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - 
Terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates 
Sometimes improbable story

The fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea

Ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride 
A ` girls gone wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document 
Useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal

Of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects

Consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt 
Sodden and glum

I did n't laugh .

Salient points 
Cruel story 
Defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
Pretentious mess 
Campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael 's evolution . 
Ca n't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie 
Derivative , overlong , and bombastic

Admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency 
A culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , 
, and yet at the end 
Actually means to face your fears 
Not a word of english 
Well-intentioned 
Wickedly sick and twisted humor 
African american professionals 
Tipped this film into the `` a '' range , as is 
Of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
Emotionally and narratively complex 
Consider it ` perfection . ' 
, structure and rhythms 
Just too silly and 
Impressive and yet lacking about everything 
Starving and untalented 
Gets clunky on the screen 
Has none of the crackle of `` fatal attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 weeks '' , or even `` indecent proposal '' , and feels more like lyne 's stolid remake of `` lolita '' . 
Personality 
To bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun 
Fails to rise above its disgusting source material 
Jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway 
An intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves 
So many distracting special effects and visual party tricks 
Disappoints 
A time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain . 
Difficult for the audience 
Utterly misplaced 
A spirited film 
The makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were

Were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
A visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .

Uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong 
An appealing couple -- 
Juwanna mann 
That 's conspicuously missing from the girls ' big-screen blowout 
An extended , open-ended poem 
And self-conscious seams 
The weird thing 
The filmmaker 's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent 
Damn funny stuff 
, the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
Despite its visual virtuosity , ` naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
So low in a poorly 
Is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut 
We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
This version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit . 
Godfrey reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
Because it overstays its natural running time 
Are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams

Turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic . 
A finale that is impenetrable and dull 
A text to ` lick , 
Like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 
Introducing an intriguing and alluring premise 
Charm , cultivation and devotion 
As though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy 
Feels like three hours 
Very well-written 
Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance 
Very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact 
Potential success 
Pale xerox of other , better crime movies 
Reflective and beautifully 
Leaving the theater with a smile on your face 
Is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
One baaaaaaaaad movie 
Unfunny 
We get the comedy we settle for . 
Hoary 
Be ( assayas ' ) homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality , 
'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it 
, as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
An american 
An unimaginative screenwriter 's 
I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes 
Even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
Stylishly 
A mess as this one 
Essentially ruined -- or , rather , 
A work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry 
A promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking 
Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , 
... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
The rope snaps 
The tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
Fanciful drama 
That delivers on the promise of excitement 
Deeply moving french drama 
Big-hearted and 
, longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
Sad ending 
Tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances . 
Adorable italian guys 
Critical 
No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . 
With exquisite craftsmanship 
Here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time 
Tens 
Maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . 
... silly humbuggery ... 
May prove to be ( tsai 's ) masterpiece 
Typed ` chris rock , ' ` anthony hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some univac-like script machine 
Might just be the movie you 're looking for 
An affection 
Love to come from an american director in years 
Most resonant film since the killer . 
Works out 
In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor 's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
The widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 
, ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
Is great 
Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
Judging by those standards , ` scratch ' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
Engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy 
, energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested . 
Confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances 
Avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style 
In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and meat loaf explodes . 
A sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
Death , especially 
By the dynamic first act 
Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level 
Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured . 
The worst sin of attributable to a movie like this 
I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
The film 's plot may be shallow 
Rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment . 
` epic 
Easy to like 
Steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture . 
An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work 
It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , 
A director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy french grandfather 
`` frailty '' has been written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit ! '' 
Are uncomfortably strained . 
Make the film more silly than scary , 
What makes it worth watching 
Has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them . 
Huge disappointment coming 
Deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride 
The rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
That the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here 
You ca n't help but feel ` stoked . ' 
Wonderful , imaginative script 
Entirely witless 
Is akin to a reader 's digest condensed version of the source material 
Fun or 
Ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon 
Shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , 
Unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller 
A film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been 
Obscenity 
Stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies 
Can be viewed as pure composition and form -- 
Look at that clever angle ! 
Of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes 
The surprisingly somber conclusion 
Not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick . 
Tepid 
's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
The low-grade cheese standards on which it operates 
Give each other the willies 
( lee ) treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . 
Is credible and remarkably mature 
Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
Of the unsung heroes of 20th century 
That 's actually sort of amazing 
That rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults 
The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant 
A streetwise mclaughlin group 
Funny and well-contructed 
's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich�� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( woo 's ) best work 
Oversimplification , superficiality and silliness 
Overproduced 
If it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags 
Though he only scratches the surface 
Awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue 
Visual splendor 
Lingering questions about what the film is really getting at 
An ` action film ' mired in stasis 
Dragon 
Most intense 
This is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
Carried out by men of marginal intelligence , 
Dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma 
That the plot makes no sense 
Too bad none of it is funny . 
Can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
Combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end 
Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels 
Well-meant 
Bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee 
America 's thirst for violence 
So horrendously confusing 
Avarice 
When you 're a struggling nobody 
Talkiness 
`` ballistic : ecks vs. sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film . 
Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
Manage to be spectacularly outrageous 
Cookie-cutter action scenes 
Of the best since the last waltz 
To lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade 
A pale imitation 
Withered 
Pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report 
A wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent 
Writing , skewed characters , 
To provoke them 
Remarkable skill 
Is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
Enough sentimental 
Crawl up your own *** 
There 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
That sends you out of the theater feeling 
A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study 
Engaging comedy 
Certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes 
Strong performances 
Is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr. drew barrymore . 
Folds under its own thinness . 
Itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension 
Conceptual feat 
, sitting through dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
Genuine rather than pandering 
Randolph 
Great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers 
Did i miss something ? 
A porno flick 
This is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . 
Simply by accident 
Nothing special 
Never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it 
This movie 's lack of ideas 
Cynicism 
Take an entirely stale concept and 
, wit and interesting characters 
Is an all-time low for kevin costner 
A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling 
It is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson 
Surprising flair 
I liked it just enough . 
An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy french grandfather . 
Some of the back-story is a little tired 
Nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
Huppert ... is magnificent 
Puzzle whose pieces do not fit 
Sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , 
-- and long -- for its own good 
Of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun 
Intrigue 
Its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily 
Is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing 
Kid-empowerment 
A fascinating , unnerving examination 
Could as easily have been called ` under siege 3 : in alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
Odoriferous thing 
Brilliantly written and well-acted 
To gravity and plummets 
It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and 
Joy 
Is wickedly fun to watch 
The imagined glory of their own pasts 
Deft 
A low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . 
Does n't have a passion for the material . 
But that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
A climax 
, scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys 
Neil burger 's impressive fake documentary 
In looking at the comic effects of jealousy 
Is tenderly observant of his characters . 
Its dark , delicate treatment 
Has no idea of it is serious 
Brutal and 
He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , 
It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
Classify as it is hard to resist 
, undisputed scores a direct hit . 
Of menacing atmosphere 
Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic 
Perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters 
In luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago 
Usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona 
Easy jokes and insults 
Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
A sincerely crafted picture 
What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
Long gone 
The movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
Is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce 
An excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins 
By a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
About how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
Soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
Spontaneity in its execution 
Feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful . 
Spiderman rocks 
Low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and 
Was n't one of the film 's virtues . 
Style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast 
Stirs us as well . 
A non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
Your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna 's cameo does n't suck ! 
An uneven film for the most part 
, the movie sinks into an abyss of clich��s , depression and bad alternative music . 
Miracles 
His storytelling skills have eroded 
`` shakes the clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme 
, others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
The film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
, madonna is one helluva singer . 
Hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and 
Will probably find it fascinating 
Good ear 
Undistinguished rhythm 
Have no idea what in creation is going on 
Fascinating but flawed look 
Spend years trying to comprehend it 
Is both a snore and utter tripe 
To treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and 
Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
The gloss 
We hate ( madonna ) within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground 
Bitter italian comedy 
Banal dialogue 
Of the smarter offerings the horror genre 
It rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it 
Optimism 
But in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself 
As a tarantula , helga 
Like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller 's time out 
Been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand 
Wannabe comedy 
Afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience 
The better video-game-based flicks , 
Little action , almost no suspense or believable tension

Leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie ... without neglecting character development for even one minute 
Frightening war scenes 
Tremendous piece 
Must have been astronomically bad 
The movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult 
Goes by quickly 
And that makes all the difference . 
The filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept 
At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
Spotty 
Amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
While the performances are often engaging 
You 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer 
Solid filmmaking 
His outstanding performance

A gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers 
Perfect example

A wacky , screwball comedy

The movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
Gorgeous color palette 
Starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together 
, ballistic : ecks vs. sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
An older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy . 
A mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports

For the rest of us , sitting through dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
Gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , ( harris ) brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman .

Of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation

, you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg 's work . 
Works against itself 
I hated myself in the morning . 
With efficiency and an affection for the period 
Confection that 's pure entertainment 
Bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority 
The intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor 
Is impressive 
If cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790 's , one imagines the result would look like something like this . 
... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
Of the jokes , most at women 's expense 
Fascination , and 
Amazing slapstick 
Low , very low , 
Weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen 
Leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
Told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday 
Those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime . 
Undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold 
Starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television 
Is even worse 
The inspiration of the original 
If oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but was n't 
Fine idea 
Mawkish 
Payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he 's the best brush in the business . 
The most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
So stupid 
A good chance of being the big 
Wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness 
It 's a masterpeice . 
A sour taste 
, much better . 
But on the whole , you 're gon na like this movie . 
A central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
The picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
Buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role 
Are too simplistic to maintain interest 
Most wondrously gifted artists 
Rushed , 
Relies less on forced air than on petter n?ss ' delicate , clever direction ... and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
Thanks to the presence of ` the king 
Surreal ache of mortal awareness 
The unexplored story opportunities of `` punch-drunk love '' may have worked against the maker 's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
By movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others 
Economical 
As powerful rather than cloying 
Its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant 
Does n't add up to a whole lot . 
In perfect balance 
Ridicule factor 
Thriller `` new best friend '' 
Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be 
Spider invasion comic chiller 
Long , slow and dreary 
Video games are more involving than this mess . 
A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness 
Inspiration and 
Witty dialogue and inventive moments 
The creative animation work 
Slice of comedic bliss 
A fluid and mesmerizing sequence 
Doing its namesake proud 
Although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired 
A renowned indian film culture 
The 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes . 
Does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story . 
30 seconds of plot 
, it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
Was better 
Interesting story 
A marvel of production design . 
Will leave you wanting to abandon the theater 
Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital 
They do n't fit well together and 
The pushiness and decibel volume 
Diverse 
Rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting 
Deep intelligence and 
Bad-movie 
Than their funny accents 
Fun , popcorn movies 
Campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
Uniqueness 
Interesting and thoroughly 
( shyamalan ) turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
Does seem pretty unbelievable at times 
Those monologues stretch on and on 
A perfect wildean actor 
You wo n't be disappointed 
Friendship , 
Put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese 
As an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable . 
Virtuoso throat-singing 
Recognize 
Gives human nature its unique feel 
Every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy 
Ferrara 's best film 
Uneventful 
You of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world 
Of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness 
The work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep 
Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness 
Establishes its ominous mood and tension 
Almost unbearably 
Has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed 
Loved ones 
Me as unusually and unimpressively fussy 
Is nothing but boilerplate clich��s from start to finish 
Gorgeousness . 
The intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire 
Of domestic tension and unhappiness 
Very talented 
The movie dragged on 
Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
He had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
Is definitely a director to watch . 
Surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving 
's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
Is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , 
Into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department 
Make this a charmer . 
His lack 
The year 's greatest adventure 
Both the beauty of the land and the people 
Entirely irony-free 
How it washed out despite all of that 
When twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we 'd live in if argento 's hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve 
Of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
Few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt 's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying 
Laugh once ( maybe twice ) 
A one-of-a-kind work 
Perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
Many can aspire but none can equal 
Retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
That ca n't get sufficient distance from leroy 's 
Is n't a very involving one 
Simpler , leaner 
Pointless extremes 
A poignant comedy that offers food for thought . 
Consistent with the messages espoused in the company 's previous video work 
... hokey art house pretension . 
Because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks 
( hell is ) looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara is n't even halfway through . 
Are complex and quirky , but entirely believable 
A potentially trite and overused concept 
... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows 
Impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head 
Closed 
An energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up 
Struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones 
Useless 
Allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself 
Faltering half-step 
... portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
Intricately constructed 
A fantastically vital movie 
Sensitive and 
Survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller 
The master of disguise is awful . 
Entertaining and , ultimately , 
Those gimmicks

To be wholesome and subversive at the same time

Has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy 
Combustible mixture

Pleasing verisimilitude 
Affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
Works beautifully 
To its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release 
Putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank 
A touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes .

Absurd collection 
Nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin 
Too safe

Of virtually plotless meanderings

The spectacle of small-town competition 
Terrific role 
Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film 
Viewed as pure composition and form -- 
The performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
Problems and 
Dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost

A minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera ... 
'' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
You want the story to go on and on 
Assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
Brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination 
Is part of the fun 
Overwrought 
Sterling 
Tells a deeper story 
That thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about 
Uneasily 
The characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
A backbone 
The hook 
Suck the audience in 
Strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances 
Even more haunting than those in mr. spielberg 's 1993 classic 
A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket 
Courageous scottish lady 
Feel like you were n't invited to the party 
Allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
Edgy thriller 
As the film breaks your heart 
The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster . 
From a stunningly unoriginal premise 
The film does pack some serious suspense . 
Tiring 
'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state 
An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you 
Tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony 
Proves itself a more streamlined 
With remarkable serenity and discipline 
Does the nearly impossible 
There 's some outrageously creative action in the transporter ... ( b ) ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck 
Too much syrup 
Its critical backlash 
Imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics 
Becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
Was inspired 
The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
Bland songs 
Like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank 
That was hard for me to warm up to 
Beyond the end zone 
Figures prominently in this movie 
Staged like `` rosemary 's baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
'' exceeds expectations . 
Inventiveness 
Was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention . 
Open yourself up to mr. reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set 
Sit through -- despite some first-rate performances 
The action is dazzling 
Director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world 's greatest teacher 
Held hostage 
Is visually ravishing 
Thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic . 
Will prefer this new version 
Be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as 
It 's kind of insulting , both to men and women . 
Wall 
Despite slick production values and director roger michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
, crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
Strange and beautiful film . 
's just too boring and obvious 
, uneven action comedy 
All this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
Funny fanatics 
Fantastic movie 
Make love a joy to behold . 
Better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
Nothing but an episode 
Their bodies 
Is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
Showcases a group of dedicated artists 
The quaking essence of passion , grief and fear 
Pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
Very , very good reasons 
The pleasures of a well-made pizza 
An ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested 
Rather simplistic 
I 've never bought from telemarketers , but i bought this movie . 
's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
To narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power 
Lost and desolate 
Tears welled up in my eyes both times 
Potentially good comic premise 
What once was conviction is now affectation 
Tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theaters 
As fascinating 
That with really poor comedic writing 
Offers few surprises 
Hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - 
Weave a protective cocoon around his own ego 
War-weary marine 
Painfully padded . 
A sharp , amusing study of the cult 
Entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action 
Flirts with propaganda 
Of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick 
Agreed 
To keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity 
Is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise 
Including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen 
He has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
Subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances 
Paul cox needed to show it . 
Skip this dreck 
Marginal intelligence 
Delightfully so 
That martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere 
Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
Nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
A few laughs 
Veret�� has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
This is just lazy writing . 
Becomes a soulful , incisive meditation 
Are of the highest and the performances 
Zips along with b-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special . 
Is that i ca n't wait to see what the director does next . 
With so much first-rate talent 
In welcome perspective 
Seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was ... 
Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances 
The visuals , even erotically frank ones , 
Meeting , even exceeding expectations , it 's the best sequel since the empire strikes back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
Believe that resident evil is not it . 
The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive 
Mctiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious 
The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work 
Upbeat ending 
Pokemon 4ever 
For granted in most films are mishandled here 
Smug grin 
's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , mad cows 
Laughs -- sometimes a chuckle 
None of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting is n't , either , and you would n't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 
, moving , and adventurous directorial debut 
Skillfully assembled , 
The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why 
Samuel l. jackson is one of the best actors there is . 
Treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
Grabs you 
May lack the pungent bite of its title , but 
To pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
Sustain interest to the end 
Should come with the warning `` for serious film buffs only ! '' 
Own ambitious goals 
That 's enough to sustain laughs 
A solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony 
In hero worship 
Feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject 
Unexpected flashes of dark comedy 
Is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
The high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts 
Inspiration 
Lifelong concern 
A charm that 's conspicuously missing from the girls ' big-screen blowout 
Neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is 
Delightfully 
Brilliant and brutal 
Repeated at least four times 
A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news 
Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing . 
Futile 
Month 
-- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting 
Collapses under its own meager weight . 
A satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted 
Flat , unconvincing 
The film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion . 
It may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
Love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . 
Unusual homes 
, beautifully realized 
The misery 
's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly 
Is this so boring 
Such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen 
With heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long 
's rarely as entertaining as it could have been 
Pretty good little movie 
That places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective 
That the movie has no idea of it is serious or 
The creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree . 
Willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching 
Here a more annoying , though less angry 
Hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss 
( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics ) 
Warped logic 
's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
The film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy 
About death 
Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
Push it through the audience 's meat grinder one more time 
Bertrand tavernier 's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( `` laissez-passer '' ) wears its heart on its sleeve 
This is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
The best of hollywood 's comic-book 
, brilliant and macabre 
Bitter nor sweet 
Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
A canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex 
The film 's saving graces 
Irreparably 
Is a riveting , brisk delight . 
Slapstick and unfunny tricks 
, bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
So warm and fuzzy 
Surefire , beloved genres 
Abysmally 
Making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time 
Some real vitality and even art 
Dumb fart 
How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
Logical , unforced continuation 
Contrived , awkward 
That will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice 
A lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels 
Is among wiseman 's warmest . 
That you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of the longest yard 
's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed 
... hits every cliche we 've come to expect , including the assumption that `` crazy '' people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny . 
`` gangs '' is never lethargic 
Bravura performance 
Whet one 's appetite for the bollywood films 
Beautiful scene 
Uninspired preachy and clich��d war 
Updated dickensian sensibility 
The quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions 
A fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor 
, the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 
However , it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
Could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again 
Too much norma rae 
Technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive 
The best the contest received 
Suffers from all the excesses 
Is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
` it 's painful to watch witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . ' 
Is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . 
Seen as hip , winking social commentary 
Rare family movie 
No laughs . 
Little less bling-bling and a lot more 
His machismo 
Played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman ca n't save it 
The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
In alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life 
The uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special 
Beautiful work 
Sane and breathtakingly creative film 
Wonder 
I encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale 's tale -- 
Hide new secretions 
's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness 
A pathetically 
Dull-witted and disquietingly creepy 
A consummate actor incapable of being boring 
Becomes too heavy for the plot 
With an assurance worthy of international acclaim 
The delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction 
All the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost 
Traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
Gratingly unfunny 
In narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute 
Has a solid emotional impact . 
Troubled and 
Sketchiest 
Holm does his sly , intricate magic , 
Britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel 
Emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
A love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
Will find millions of eager fans . 
Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
Presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) 
For some major alterations 
Is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in 
Relatively dry 
... a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
Too easy 
Of these tragic deaths 
Is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication 
Bump in the night and nobody cares 
Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but 
Is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream 
Falls to the floor with a sickening thud 
's little to recommend snow dogs 
The sick character 
Sentimental mess 
That the movie does not do them justice 
Its story 
Astonishing ... ( frames ) profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment 
Exudes the urbane sweetness 
This starts off with a 1950 's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . 
A sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 
Take me back to a time 
Induces headaches 
Takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women 
Like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids 
Julie taymor 's preposterous titus 
Be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
Ultimately undo him 
You turn stupid 
Humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life 
Delightfully unpredictable , hilarious 
A computer-generated cold fish 
, one hour photo lives down to its title . 
Worldly-wise and very funny script 
As a fairly weak retooling 
Polished and vastly entertaining 
Resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material 
Simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply 
Satisfyingly unsettling ride 
The past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while 
Search of purpose or even a plot 
An oddly winning portrayal of one of life 's ultimate losers 
Terrible 
Mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . 
's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong 
The best espionage picture 
Lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
Tens of thousands of german jewish refugees 
Some startling , surrealistic moments 
Annoying rather than charming 
Is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right . 
Impeccable comic timing 
Do well to cram earplugs in their ears and 
Is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen 
Takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth 
Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck 
For its excellent storytelling , its economical 
Is generous and deep 
Failed 
Most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics 
It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal . 
The compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made ( eyre 's ) first film something of a sleeper success 
The year 's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments 
Superbly 
French coming-of-age import 
Capable of anteing up some movie star charisma 
A cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around 
Sad but 
Esteemed 
The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
Problematic quest 
Substantial or fresh 
Watchable by a bravura performance 
Labute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering . 
Misdemeanor 
, has solid acting and a neat premise 
Is infectious 
It cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle . 
I must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
Sad schlock merchant 
Its poignancy hooks us completely 
Less bling-bling 
Slickly staged 
Sluggish pace and lack 
Relies on subtle ironies and visual devices 
Exaggerated action 
Are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
A movie to forget 
's fun , 
The central flaw of the film 
's too loud 
Wallowing in its characters ' frustrations 
The men and machines behind the curtains of our planet 
A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai 's vaunted empathy 
Makes the journey feel like a party 
A spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
Truly , truly bad 
On , well , love in the time of money 
The story 's scope and pageantry 
Uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows 
A quaint , romanticized rendering 
Be glued to the screen 
Warmth and 
The plot has a number of holes , 
A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid 
Oliver stone 's conspiracy thriller jfk 
Clever , amusing and unpredictable 
None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens 
Rambling incoherence 
Has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances 
, intelligent eyes 
Scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm 
France 's most inventive directors 
The ideal outlet 
Were convinced to waste their time 
's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . 
Created a masterful work of art of their own 
Linklater 
( green is ) the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i 'm just about ready to go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
No . . 
Just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
Bad '' is the operative word for `` bad company 
, you still have to see this ! 
It stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . 
Proves a servicable world war ii drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
Get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized 
Display greatness 
It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
The gentle comic treatment 
Is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ... 
Grounded in an undeniable social realism 
Feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy 
, ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . ' 
None of this sounds promising and 
The film is well worthwhile . 
Patience , respect and affection 
Every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length 
Uncomfortably close to losing my lunch 
To give them credit for : the message of the movie 
Remotely new or interesting 
Can hear you snore 
Says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style 
, sloppy 
Falls far short 
Scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
Be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop 
Appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich�� 
See her esther blossom as an actress , 
Delivers big time 
That is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience 
Formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff 
Smear 
A thriller with an edge 
Delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion 
Dubious human being 
There 's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
Conquers 
Bottom-rung new jack city wannabe . 
To show us why it 's compelling 
Is hardly a masterpiece 
, the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . 
Emerge with unimpeachable clarity 
For most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m. night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
This film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events 
Poorly-constructed comedy 
Aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice 
Rousing , g-rated family film 
Absurdist wit 
A mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis 
Hoffman 's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
Bill morrison 's decasia 
Usually dread encountering the most 
Sure to win viewers ' hearts 
Ca n't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . 
Must have been lost in the translation . 
Despite auteuil 's performance 
Option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept 
At an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans 
The thin veneer 
The delicate forcefulness 
If the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness 
Will just as likely make you weep 
's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
Like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
Nation 
Is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , 
Scream low budget 
The only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
Of the potential for sanctimoniousness 
Interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity 
Lacks dramatic punch and depth 
David caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
You want to slap it 
Great performances , stylish cinematography and 
Can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
Garden music video 
Nice piece of work 
Knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized 
A re-hash 
Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
Tired old vision 
Lame 
Snl '' has-been 
Horrible . 
A pretentious and 
Is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade 
Any movie with a life-affirming message 
To the experience 
Even worse 
Every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy 
Wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen 
Tub-thumpingly loud 
Will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
How long will filmmakers copy the `` saving private ryan '' battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg 
Is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure 
Highly uneven 
One of the most exciting action films 
Offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience 
Is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
Clich��-riddled genre 
A better script 
, then go see this delightful comedy . 
Disguise the slack complacency of ( godard 's ) vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice 
Absurdist 
Seem like a bad idea from frame one 
Of grace 
Bright shining star 
Romantic and serenely 
A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
Ick 
It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture 
Is far from disappointing , 
Cliffhanger 
Photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
Its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before . 
Fussing over too weak a recipe 
Touched by an unprecedented tragedy 
Looking for a return ticket to realism 
Really is enormously good fun . 
Includes battlefield earth and showgirls 
For casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
Over-the-top trash 
That should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it 
Because of the universal themes , earnest performances 
Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , 
's nothing wrong with that 
Convincing portrayal 
It drags during its 112-minute length 
, it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame . 
Quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship 
An engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character . 
The film never recovers from the clumsy clich�� of the ugly american abroad , 
Aimless , arduous , and arbitrary 
A lot of the credit for the film 's winning tone must go to grant , who has n't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
Sports extravaganza 
I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and 
Loose , poorly structured film 
And as bland 
It must be labeled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' 
Where the old adage `` be careful what you wish for '' 
Its audience giddy 
Implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history 
Piercing 
Its recycled aspects , 
Its true-to-life characters , 
Limpid and conventional historical fiction 
Pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
Dark to be decipherable 
Stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites 
Seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
That begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
Kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , 
's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical 
Is dark , brooding and slow 
Hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers 
There is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
Handed down from the movie gods 
Are , with the drumming routines , among the film 's saving graces . 
That it avoids the obvious with humor and lightness 
Get excited about on this dvd 
'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
Of artifice and purpose 
That surprises or delights 
Is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
Was immensely enjoyable 
Pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale 
Easier to digest 
Contest to see who can out-bad-act the other 
What an idea , what a thrill ride . 
From a television monitor 
No better or worse than ` truth or consequences , n.m. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
Enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle . 
Fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile 
A good human 
The most surprising thing about this film 
Unfortunately also 
A great american adventure 
Imaginative 
Of his most daring , and complicated , performances 
Aimless , arduous , 
Too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece 
Is where ararat went astray . 
Prove diverting enough 
To places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie 
A generic bloodbath 
Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
The novel charm 
Pathetic idea 
A bad improvisation exercise , 
A major waste ... generic 
Only surprise 
As beautiful , desirable 
Come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
Wonderful fencing scenes and 
Sure , it 's contrived and predictable 
Absolute joy 
Heart as important as humor 
Creative energy and wit to entertain all ages 
Into a poem of art , music and metaphor 
Laughed that hard in years 
This goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest 
, assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others 
Mostly fool 's gold 
Know what it wants to be when it grows up 
Its amiable jerking 
Emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment 
A boring , pretentious muddle 
, it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie 
Gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality 
Would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects 
Not only a pianist , but a good human being 
What could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman 's tragic odyssey . 
Owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
's better to go in knowing full well what 's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . 
Driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm 
Well-put-together 
Is so rich with period minutiae 
Grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor 
Is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
More ambivalent set 
I ca n't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
Rambles aimlessly 
A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . 
Sweeping , dramatic 
Numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
Edits 
Is n't entirely persuasive 
Smart and well-crafted 
Sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and 
Some laughs and a smile 
Derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films 
So it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but 
The movie is better than you might think . 
By a british cast 
An intimate feeling 
Recommended -- 
Tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims 
A mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense 
Humble , teach and ultimately 
First-class , natural acting and 
Gross-out humor 
Solemn pretension 
About memory and regret 
Best indie of the year , so far . 
The byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen ( vega ) and juni ( sabara ) cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . 
Like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 
Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... well before the end 
Enjoyable family fare 
A more mythic level 
Strong supporting players 
Watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement 
Is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
Well-behaved film 
A genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago 
Of a handsome and well-made entertainment 
, you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
, i ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
Showcase the canadian 's inane ramblings 
Best little `` horror '' movie 
Am��lie 's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest 
Every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it ? 
Found a cult favorite 
Feels familiar and tired 
As well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody 
Familiar , funny 
Imaginatively mixed 
Cold blanket 
No idea what in creation is going on 
I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking 
The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , 
A century and a half ago 
Sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously 
A knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , 
Bad movie . 
Being neither 
Is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration 
A huge heart 
Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold 
The wrong things 
Kids-cute sentimentality 
Raunchy and frequently hilarious 
A wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long 
Improvise and scream 
Big bad love 
The film does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
Do n't want to think too much about what 's going on 
What makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors 
Delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph 
Rich with period minutiae 
Sick , twisted sort 
Just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on 
Laziness and arrogance 
Two fatal ailments 
It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . 
This clever and very satisfying picture 
The trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
With so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks 
The trailer is a riot . 
, this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
No rooting interest 
Remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . 
Entertaining thriller 
This is n't a stand up and cheer flick ; it 's a sit down and ponder affair 
Robotically italicized 
Incompetent cops 
Mind-numbing 
Become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters 
Common sense 
Bodacious 
This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
Lead actress ga? , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , 
Well-meant but unoriginal . 
We , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life 
Thuds 
Setting distracts 
Asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well 
A realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales . 
Both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... 
Of this sad , compulsive life 
Told and retold 
Joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
In the series 
Written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
Slow 
Be a single iota worse 
Protect your community 
A bit repetitive 
Elegant 
Meaningful cinema 
Strongest film 
Dumb gags , anatomical humor , 
It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story 
A stupid , derivative horror film 
This often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy 
Revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions 
Efficient 
Can certainly go the distance , 
With a teeth-clenching gusto 
Delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling 
Helpful 
Succeeds through sincerity . 
As a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . 
Exceptional performances 
It 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
I would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful . 
Has value can not be denied . 
Amusing for a good while 
Clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
Major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera 
Make a delightful comedy centering on food 
Imbue the theme with added depth and resonance 
Staggeringly unoriginal terms 
Contradictory things 
A blair witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast 
Compelling investigation 
French to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama 
Are no special effects , and no hollywood endings . 
Has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best 
I honestly never knew what the hell was coming next 
You to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists 
Masterpiece 
As a friend 
Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
Rated eee for excitement .

Honestly 
Intriguing and downright intoxicating 
Slick and sprightly cgi feature 
The hilarious writer-director himself 
A mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in 
Throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling 
Terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; 
Have a bad , bad , bad movie 
For no apparent reason except 
See a better thriller

That was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash 
Reduces wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon 
The feel of poetic tragedy 
Had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain 
Lack depth or complexity , 
, this is the ultimate movie experience 
Cerebral 
I stay positive 
Be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still 
A believable mother/daughter pair 
1993 classic 
Pretty funny movie 
-- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- 
Future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter 
It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
Dinner guest 
Degenerates 
Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting 
Students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . 
Told with humor and poignancy 
An unexpectedly sweet story 
It brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history 
The problems with the film 
Analyze this , not 
Expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
Washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him 
Sounds like horrible poetry 
To ignite sparks 
Is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
So intimate 
It does so without compromising that complexity . 
Most charmless 
Love , family 
A full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
Endearing , masterful 
Befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject 
A very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy . 
A dull girl , 
You 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger 
Graceful , moving tribute 
Is enticing 
We only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic 
The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
Mordantly funny and intimately knowing ... 
Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment 
Make fun of me for liking showgirls 
As a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension 
Instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
Wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv 's big brother

Get lost in the murk of its own making 
Woozy 
Is its reliance on formula , though 
If you grew up on scooby -- you 'll love this movie . 
It does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
An interesting technical exercise 
Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
Is a visual treat for all audiences . 
Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and 
Some body will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have .

Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .

Stay away

's appealingly manic and energetic 
An uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . ' 
Actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode 
Has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life 
Sympathizing with terrorist motivations 
A chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead 
, wendigo , larry fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 
At once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
A solid cast 
Is worth seeking . 
Technically 
Chuckles 
Amounts to little more than punishment 
The music makes a nice album , 
Like mike is a slight and uninventive movie 
've seen ( eddie ) murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed 
, there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone . 
Me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story 
Sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , 
Stylized sequences 
To be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images 
Sinks into by-the-numbers territory 
More enjoyable than i expected 
At one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness 
Men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic 
About one in three gags in white 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
A beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- 
's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can 
Manages , with terrific flair 
Its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham 
On both sides it falls short 
Marvelous series 
Does n't have all the answers 
The first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray 
Seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags 
The filmmaker would disagree 
Connection or identification frustratingly 
Provide insight 
Turned out to be a one-trick pony 
's hard to resist 
Found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally 
Rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson 's creek 
Short running 
Fake , dishonest

Then you 're in for a painful ride . 
Director hoffman , his writer and kline 's agent should serve detention 
Inspired '' was a lot funnier 
Can do even more damage 
A strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing 
Encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity 
Quiet , confident 
A legal thriller 
An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
Feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo 
You do n't care who fires the winning shot 
Can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
Better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
Affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
, thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 
Mind crappy movies as much as adults , 
Deliberately and skillfully 
Insomnia is one of the year 's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances 
Too many films 
Banal , virulently unpleasant excuse 
An unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen 
Are both superb , while huppert ... is magnificent . 
The film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale 
Smile-button faces 
Admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
Like mike shoots and scores 
The none-too-original premise 
Once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue 
A solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . 
Leave us with a sense of wonder 
Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle 
To smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television 
Did n't care . 
Precocious 
Dog soldiers does n't transcend genre 
A twisted sense of humor 
The power-lunchers do n't care to understand 
Performers who rarely work in movies now 
That embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
Live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it

Balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , 
The proverbial paint dry 
Once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .

Deeply humanistic artist 
The good and different idea ( of middle-aged romance ) is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` never again . '' 
For idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
A rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical 
As brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema 
The only thing to fear about `` fear dot com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
Personal tragedy and 
Is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia 
Repetitive 
It 's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . 
Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
The seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children 
Joyful

Interesting and 
The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped 
Is first-rate , especially sorvino . 
Anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels 
Of the outstanding thrillers of recent years 
Purports 
There 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff 
With the best of herzog 's works 
's plenty to enjoy 
Designed as a reverie about memory and regret , 
Though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem 
Is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness 
That it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action 
The paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why did n't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
Excellent 
Incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap 
Play out realistically if not always fairly . 
Imitation movie 
Let the subtitles fool you 
A morbid one 
's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow 
Achingly honest 
Nice little story 
Better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . 
Tiresome as 9 
Mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart 
A plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace 
, a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
The bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks 
Its awkward structure and a final veering 
Is beautiful and mysterious 
Is very original 
, it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
A rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation 
A confusing drudgery . 
Sitting through this one 
It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , 
Is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
Thanks to the presence of ` the king , ' it also rocks . 
Remarkable performances 
Possibly the worst film 
The three leads produce adequate performances , 
Confusing 
A staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways 
A bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over 
Historically significant work 
Is exceedingly pleasant 
The numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time 
's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
Compelling new material 
This distinguished actor would stoop so low 
This sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special 
Is surely 
's far from a groundbreaking endeavor 
Probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters 
Exhilarating new interpretation 
That 's been done before 
Chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and

Simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances . 
Be smarter and more diabolical 
Even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making 
If good-hearted 
Is n't heated properly , 
Gets around to its real emotional business 
More than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
That if the video is n't back at blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees 
Is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
, hollywood is sordid and disgusting . 
Stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener 
Her defiance 
A 90-minute , four-star movie 
Is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst 
Downright creepy

A sun-drenched masterpiece , 
Obnoxious and didactic burlesque 
This retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself .

The best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen 
A good idea 
The jokes are flat , 
The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .

Grab your kids and run and then probably call the police

Though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
The best comedy concert movie i 've seen since cho 's previous concert comedy film 
Than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
Insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . 
Is a career-defining revelation . 
Funny and fun 
Witty dialog between realistic characters 
, why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
The cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film 
Doze off during this one 
Watch , giggle 
A gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters 
Expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape 
All comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad 
Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr. chips off the old block 
Baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic 
Nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film 
Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated . 
By its own pretentious self-examination 
It is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .

Sickeningly 
Strangely funny 
The irksome , tiresome nature of complacency 
A perfect medium 
Plays like a tired tyco ad . 
While american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place 
Sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
If you have the patience for it , you wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours 
A classy , sprightly spin on film . 
Is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes

Too good to be bad 
A lot of warmth

Christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists 
A vibrant and intoxicating fashion 
'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
Big-budget/all-star movie

A disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title ...

Enough sardonic 
If you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
Seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
That seagal 's overweight and out of shape 
Ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
In a bid to hold our attention 
It becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead

Politically charged 
Witty , vibrant , and intelligent . 
Seem less of a trifle if ms. sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine 
The perfect star vehicle 
Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
Befuddling

What really sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
The last kiss is really all about performances . 
Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , 
A dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny 
It 's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
That might have made no such thing 
Gondry 's direction is adequate 
Experimentation and improvisation

Clever ways 
A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable 
Fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
Off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' 
Thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies 
Leonine power 
So primitive in technique 
How good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
Some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier 
Bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery 
A first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you

Pained 
Lost his touch

An experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal 
Is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience 
Cinematic postcard 
A thriller 
's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
... bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
That are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
Follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , 
Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , 
A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
Might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
Director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
Natural and 
Bargain-basement special 
No wit , only labored gags 
Has a huge heart 
A compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds . 
Puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers 
Look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten 
A questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence 
In amusing us 
It was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
The laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america 
Quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic 
It 's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
This three-hour endurance test 
Well-paced and 
Unexpectedly sweet story 
Awfully good , achingly human 
The heart of the film 
Like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it 
The character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear 
Of his reserved but existential poignancy 
Creative animation work 
It 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance . 
Really get inside of them 
Lust and love 
That it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened 
Helped give a spark to `` chasing amy '' and `` changing lanes '' falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` the sum of all fears 
Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' 
Laughing 
There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
Is ) the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , 
Ominous mood and tension 
Competent direction 
Burns 's strongest film 
Hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory

Hollywood disregard 
Weaving a theme throughout this funny film 
A potentially good comic premise 
A revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
I heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format 
Soulless techno-tripe 
To take us on his sentimental journey of the heart 
Originality ai n't on the menu , but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller 
Of continuity errors 
It is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy 
Sent back to the tailor for some major alterations 
None of the crackle of `` fatal attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 weeks '' , 
Is left slightly unfulfilled 
Deserving of its oscar nomination 
The journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
Not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose 
The poor quality of pokemon 4 
Joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
Likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies 
Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , 
The story and ensuing complications are too manipulative 
Rock solid family fun 
Will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
A barf bag 
300 years of russian history and culture 
Winning portrayal 
Of warmth and humor 
Sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick 
Will have you talking 'til the end of the year 
That is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
Cliched 
The real-life story is genuinely inspirational 
Wonderfully warm 
, interestingly told film . 
The story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . 
Too many tried-and-true shenanigans 
Seem more like medicine 
A lot like a well-made pb & j sandwich 
Emotionally intense 
A bump on the head 
Friendship , love , and 
Comedies to hit the screen in years 
Ultimately fails 
The unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid 
Refreshingly realistic , 
It 's a sad , sick sight 
... rogers 's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle . 
Appealing about the characters 
, potent exploration 
Feel like a short stretched out to feature length 
A recycled and dumbed-down version 
Energy and wit to entertain all ages 
She gets to fulfill her dreams 
Be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming 
That 's part of what makes dover kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent 
A cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie 
, elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry . 
Tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough 
Sweet , funny , charming , and 
By 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy 
How to make us share their enthusiasm 
Loosely tied 
Feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick 
Which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again 
Rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - 
Except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it 
A lovely film ... 
Create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time 
Well worthwhile 
Feels the dimming of a certain ambition 
Is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much 
For the most part wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and parker 's creative interference 
Yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling 
Its writer-director 's 
It 's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
Bomb 
No one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest ` tron ' anderson , seems entirely improvised 
Skip the film and 
Colorfully 
The complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen 
Who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world 
It is 
Convincing 
Bits funnier 
That stubbornly refused to gel 
Has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
All the bad things 
Is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane . 
The enticing prospect 
Prettiest pictures 
Engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks 
This material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent 
From ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired 
Are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels 
Is laughingly 
Is more than a movie 
Perfectly rendered 
Hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
A mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make ` cherish ' a very good ( but not great ) movie . 
Suspenseful 
Intriguing and honorable 
About art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise 
Like a fish that 's lived too long 
Is more accurately chabrolian . 
This is one of mr. chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
Deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance . 
Found it weirdly appealing 
It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled 
Has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
Smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy 
Contemplation 
Exciting documentary . 
This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it . 
Plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
A compelling piece 
Beautifully sung holiday carol 
Best work 
Famous moments 
He 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit 
Lovely and amazing 
Nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences 
, in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic 
It unexpectedly rewarding 
's no rooting interest 
Forgettable 
A sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination 
Downright comically evil 
Preachy and clich��d 
Broomfield is energized by volletta wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness 
The passion , creativity , and fearlessness 
Through its otherwise comic narrative 
Enlivens 
Dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances 
A great american adventure and 
The director 's talent 
The film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
The film 's intimate camera work and searing performances 
The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
` wow ' factor 
Is well crafted , and well executed 
Very stupid and annoying 
It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt . 
That it 's also one of the smartest 
Contenders 
Undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy 
I wo n't be sitting through this one again 
This movie has the usual impossible stunts ... but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
Put through torture for an hour and a half 
A stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with 
Landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch 
Most wondrous 
The movie is without intent . 
Incredibly captivating and insanely funny 
, the four feathers comes up short 
The most entertaining monster movies 
Stellar 
Keep it from being simpleminded 
Visual flair 
Done-to-death material 
Bad people 
It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
( russell ) makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards 
Donovan ... squanders his main asset 
Rude and 
Stink bomb . 
I thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . 
Irwin is so earnest that it 's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . 
Attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
Much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen 
Strip it of all its excess debris , 
I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
Its pretensions 
Throw smoochy from the train ! 
Loosely speaking , we 're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin 
Becomes compulsively watchable 
Dull , 
Work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse 
Triteness 
Evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain 
Gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls 
Is all the more remarkable because it 
Keep it up 
Certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories 
With such a rah-rah , patriotic tone 
Unpleasantly 
If the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened 
A return ticket 
Hardened indie-heads 
A beautiful food entr��e that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless 
Takes to describe how bad it is 
A delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry 
Movie rapes 
... has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
Rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
Creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky 's diaries 
Snow dogs deserves every single one of them 
Incredibly layered and stylistic film 
At a snail 's pace 
A better satiric target 
Flair and bouncing bravado 
A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
Get weird , 
The execution is pretty weary 
Is at once intimate and universal cinema 
Complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days 
Surgeon mends 
Will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering 
Flawless film , ( wang ) 
No palpable chemistry 
's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull 
Uncreative 
Its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing 
Is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery . 
A strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
Lustrous polished 
Offers an interesting look 
Can not engage 
Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya . 
How love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible 
As visually bland 
Look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role 
This somewhat tired premise 
Are your cup of blood 
Limps along 
A terrific effort 
Go down in the annals of cinema 
Remarkably original work 
It 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as greenfingers 
Excruciatingly unfunny and 
Its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
Unmistakable , easy joie 
, touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot 
Imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects 
Entirely stale concept 
Will amuse or entertain them 
Wobbly premise work 
Drifts aimlessly 
Town 
Is an uneven film for the most part 
Does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers 
Of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves 
Is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop freudianism 
A cold movie 
Hard-sell image-mongering 
What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters . 
Story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre 
Lie 
, its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
Less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese 
Interesting and accessible 
Has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
, remote , emotionally distant piece 
Crime drama 
's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 
's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
Sexy , and rousing 
May sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
A faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness 
, the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
Its premise is smart 
Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun 
For a film that 's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama is n't as funny as you 'd hoped . 
's tv sitcom material at best 
Resident evil 
Often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers . 
The shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' ( 1999 ) and 
Forget its absurdity . 
Was kind of terrific once 
Mind-numbing indifference 
Ambition but no sense of pride or shame 
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though 
A crucial third act miscalculation 
The dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project 
A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel 
The soulful nuances 
Shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles 
Value whatsoever 
Tricky and satisfying 
, cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
Originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies 
's very beavis and butthead , 
Sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions 
Ripoff 
Is long on narrative and ( too ) short 
Hastily written 
Has some problems 
Remains vividly in memory long 
Made the first one charming 
Take it 
A fifty car pileup of cliches 
're struggling to create . 
Not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
It affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
Improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary 
Highly uneven and inconsistent 
Still-raw emotions 
Clint eastwood 's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb & j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
Overladen with plot conceits 
Assaults on america 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony 
Into clich��s 
Big stars and high production values are standard procedure 
Captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
Is one big , dumb action movie . 
Must be the end of the world 
Coordinated his own dv poetry 
Leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
An indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people 
Yes , but also intriguing and honorable , 
Is instead a cheap clich�� 
A modestly surprising movie . 
Keep it interested 
The very definition of epic adventure 
Jams too many prefabricated story elements 
Is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be 
In the same old story 
A compelling , gut-clutching piece 
Should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
Frozen tundra soap opera 
The premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
Cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults 
Embraces life in public 
Is generally quite funny . 
Showtime 's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches 
A catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america ... sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight 
The fierce grandeur 
De niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun 
Feeble comedy 
Thought-provoking 
Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
Have bitterly forsaken 
Deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered . 
With some fine acting 
Do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold 
Lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
Consummate actor 
To make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal 
Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
Pungent bite 
Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie 
Exude an air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
A stirring visual sequence 
Darned assured 
Plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast 
Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
Are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work . 
An interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending 
Thoroughly awful 
Technically superb 
A dashing and resourceful hero 
With heart 
Cutesy romantic tale 
Sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys 
Irritating 
Dopey 
, one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else . 
The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
That the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
Dullard 
This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem . 
Sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating 
Eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece 
Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
About being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances 
A more sheerly beautiful film 
Is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time 
Snide and prejudice 
From both a great and a terrible story , mr. nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
A movie with a bigger , fatter heart 
Had more to do with imagination than market research 
Was n't at least watchable 
Sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
Engaging and intimate 
Blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
A brilliant , absurd collection 
's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
Expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
Almost as offensive 
Will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
Fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller 
I liked the movie , 
Really vocalized 
The lion king 
Is a winner 
A new favorite musical 
The perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself 
Captain 
With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . 
Too little excitement and zero compelling storyline 
Flaws 
That 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
A re-hash of the other seven films 
A well-made pizza 
Noticeably less energy and imagination 
There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
, beloved genres 
's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies 
Collapses into an inhalant blackout 
At once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- 
A family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what 
The hype , the celebrity , 
The best advice is : ` scooby ' do n't . 
The modern master of the chase sequence 
Much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present 
Serve no other purpose 
Both overplayed and exaggerated 
That 's exactly what these two people need to find each other 
, this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 
A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
Easy to make such a worthless film 
To scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
So crass 
About every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length 
's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
Precious little of either 
That both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
Extraordinarily 
Be as bored watching morvern callar 
Crisp framing , edgy camera work , and 
Fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
( hayek ) throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina 
Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it 's a spirited film and a must-see . 
Big , fat , dumb 
Spreads itself too thin , 
A rumor of angels should dispel it . 
What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
While adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter 
Solid pedigree 
's the element of condescension , 
From a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school 
Better off staying on the festival circuit 
Exciting and well-paced 
Is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
If the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
To mention absolutely refreshed 
A fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy 
Beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game 
Staggeringly dreadful romance . 
The direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely 
Into a future they wo n't much care about 
It is n't much fun . 
Just does n't work 
, achingly human 
It sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
Becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten 
With memorable zingers 
Final verdict : you 've seen it all before . 
Affectingly 
Starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers 
Been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again 
Becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship 
) lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w. bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . 
Great submarine stories 
Of russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement 
At his 12th oscar nomination 
Managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood 
Little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics ) 
Seem at least passably real 
Not exactly assured in its execution 
Is a big time stinker 
A bland , surfacey way 
Who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest 
Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but 
Provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world 
As stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus 
Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes 
A peculiar malaise that renders its tension 
Be delightfully compatible here 
Is among wiseman 's warmest 
Interminably bleak 
Na?vet�� and arbitrary 
Witless mess 
Oddly fascinating depiction 
A stylish cast and 
Dropped 
More confused 
The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache 
A pleasure 
No solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us 
Is a commanding screen presence 
Something that really matters 
Offers no easy , comfortable resolution 
Only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick 
Those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 
Hard , endearing , caring , warm . 
Lack-of-attention span 
Clever by about nine-tenths 
Forget 
The greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
Too dry and 
Into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
Imaginative kid 's movie 
To surrealism and black comedy 
The sheer ugliness of everything else 
On shame 
That we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other 
There are some fairly unsettling scenes , 
American and 
Fine , old-fashioned-movie movie 
Rooting against , 
Overly-familiar 
Missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play 
Exploitation piece 
Stuffy 
You feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy 
An unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter 
Ten 
The obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack 
A reader 's digest condensed version 
Transcends culture and race 
Brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
That 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
There 's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat 
But seriously , folks , it does n't work . 
The execution 
Offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , 
That should be used to burn every print of the film 
Thoroughly involving 
More than a little pretentious 
Wilco fans will have a great time , 
A teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment 
A bad movie that 
Failure . 
Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed 
That 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack 
Cheap shocks 
The filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences 
The worst -- and only -- killer website movie 
's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
A glorified sitcom 
Reasonable 
Just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years 
An enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race . 
As an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it 
Set in a 1986 harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in new york . 
The humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long 
All over this `` un-bear-able '' project 
The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
Clean-cut 
Wonderfully funny

Ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel 
Disorientated

Enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension 
The son of the bride 's humor is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .

Exuberance and passion 
65-minute trifle 
As the very best of them 
Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian 's inane ramblings 
Disguise the fact 
A particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy 
To see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence 
Exasperating

Shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action . 
Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm . 
That greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby 
There 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit 
Bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
The rare sequel that 's better than its predecessor 
Glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
Such blatant and sickening product placement 
Have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way 
Captivating new film . 
To shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project 
Making it par for the course for disney sequels 
Gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug 
Has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short 
Needing other people 
It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
Ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling 
At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left 
Acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr. broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover 
Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material 
Trailer-trash style . 
Wonderfully edited 
's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie 
Imax trip 
An intelligent screenplay and 
So vivid a portrait 
Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
Spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry 
Mention `` solaris '' five years from now and i 'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
In the knowledge imparted 
Has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate 
Captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world 
It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true . 
What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender 
, implausible 
With its wry observations 
It is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers 
Handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch 
For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league 
Unrelentingly grim -- and 
Sweetest thing 
In the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
The symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent 
Biography channel 
The tuxedo was n't just bad 
I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
Less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades 
With an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
Quite vapid 
Well-done 
I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material 
Its awkward structure and 
A powerful commentary 
Recalls 
It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time 
The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
People are innocent , childlike and inherently funny 
, history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence 
Will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy . 
Goofiest stuff 
Pleased 
Short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy 
Dramatic experience . 
Quirky and satirical touches 
Quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film 
'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie 
It 's wasted yours 
Armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud 
A change in expression

It 's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so 
It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
Lucid work

Genteel and unsurprising the execution

Raised to a new , self-deprecating level 
, like ravel 's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with 
Goes on and on to the point of nausea 
The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story 
Metaphysical claptrap 
, smart , savvy , compelling

They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn . 
A collectively stellar performance

Tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy . 
Easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking 
A culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe . 
Yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie 
It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' . 
The movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .

Off-beat and fanciful film 
Came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter

Rueful , wry humor 
You 're not merely watching history 
Fairly revealing 
There surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
It was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans 
Tiresome jokes 
A major director 
Plenty of laughs 
Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh 's best films , `` erin brockovich , '' `` out of sight '' and `` ocean 's eleven , '' never were . 
In addition to being very funny 
As lame and sophomoric 
Of portraying the devastation of this disease 
Sad , sick sight 
Spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship 
Trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults 
's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish 
This is n't exactly profound cinema , but it 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny 
Of a genuine and singular artist 
That defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it 
Technically sumptuous but also 
Ungainly 
Comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel 
A delicious , quirky movie 
Tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but it feels like unrealized potential 
Worth the price of admission 
's funniest and most likeable movie in years .

Is having fun with it all 
Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago 
Have n't laughed that hard in years 
Miike 
Is kinda wrong in places 
Make interesting 
The thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
Are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
Very thrilling 
Failed jokes 
's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all 
Best sequel 
Is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
This facetious smirk 
Fifty years after the fact , the world 's political situation seems little different , and ( director phillip ) noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
Few things more frustrating 
A huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre 
Less a documentary and more propaganda 
, entertaining comedy 
Convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here . 
Pleasant and engaging enough 
, solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy 
If i want a real movie 
The character 's gripping humanity 
A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` the thing ' and a geriatric

Returning director rob minkoff ... and screenwriter bruce joel rubin 
Fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard

Stay afloat 
Painfully 
If you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ... 
Can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars 
Even kids deserve better . 
A better celebration 
Too stagey , talky 
Neil burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present . 
Small , personal film 
An autopilot hollywood concoction 
Of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile 
A skyscraper

Guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
Drowned me in boredom .

The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and 
Works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
Jerking off

The journey is such a mesmerizing one 
Starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable 
Inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
Is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be 
The movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action 
Historically significant , and 
Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
Donovan ... squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and 
Humanity or empathy

The adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense 
Gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record 
Thriller junk 
A lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud ... and parmentier 
When you instantly know whodunit 
In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , 
Fun , and 
's really just another major league . 
No unifying rhythm or visual style

Decent 
Deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .

One of those so-so films that could have been much better 
Shows what great cinema can really do 
Lazy 
Though it 's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal 
The biggest disappointments of the year 
Romantic 
For philosophers , not filmmakers 
Derivativeness

The kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while 
If this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
Painful as the grey zone 
A backseat in his own film 
Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance 
Romance , tragedy 
To convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers 
's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters 
It 's exactly the kind of movie toback 's detractors always accuse him of making . 
, standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 
Should have been a cutting hollywood satire 
Imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , 
Awesome work 
Is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see 
The most edgy piece 
Offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through . 
Sci-fi .

Written , flatly , by david kendall and 
Fleshed-out enough to build any interest 
Humor , warmth , 
True to his principles 
It 's an unhappy situation all around . 
Ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script 
Is that it 's too close to real life to make sense . 
Pleasing the crowds 
Thematically and stylistically 
A must 
Nothing but an episode of smackdown 
Atrocities 
An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
Cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images 
The chateau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . 
Crowdpleaser 
Into a black hole of dullness 
Particularly joyless , and

Emphasising her plight and isolation 
Fifth beer-soaked film

That ` alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability 
One of recent memory 's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise .

Has no snap 
An inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller 
Flat , unconvincing drama 
Superficial and unrealized 
Can get past the taboo subject matter 
Of predictable narrative rhythms 
A kind , unapologetic , sweetheart 
's awfully entertaining 
Has a genuine dramatic impact 
I think it was plato who said , ' i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theater for this one . ' 
Are simply too good 
Never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . 
Goofily endearing and well-lensed 
Feels all too familiar 
's impossible to claim that it is `` based on a true story '' with a straight face . 
Steeped in fairy tales and other childish things 
Of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance 
Lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics 
Has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
Walked out 
Wanders 
's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance 
Treading water at best in this forgettable effort 
Improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper 
That swings and jostles to the rhythms of life 
Without beauty or humor 
A fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and 
It works 
Is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 
Weary 
Convincing impersonation 
Lacks in substance 
Disconnects every 10 seconds 
Poise 
Longley 's film 
Have banged their brains into the ground so frequently 
In gross romanticization of the delusional personality type 
In their cheap , b movie way , they succeed 
Unusual biopic and document 
All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` angels with dirty faces ' appeared in 1938 
, margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken . 
Kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden 
Will turn out okay 
A little uneven to be the cat 's meow , but it 's good enough to be the purr 
Wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors 
The leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
I 'd be lying if i said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of kung pow . 
Is actually a compelling look at a young woman 's tragic odyssey . 
A chilling movie without oppressive gore . 
Much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep 
Allegedly inspiring and 
As big a crowdpleaser as 
Engross even 
Nicolas cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
Personal loss 
People to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept 
Is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis bu?uel film 
It is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia 
The story has little wit and no surprises . 
A gory slash-fest 
Alienated 
Serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally 
About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and 
Animation and game phenomenon 
Not for their acting chops , but for their looks 
Would have a good time here 
Hollywood ending is a depressing experience 
It 's always enthralling . 
Of stunning images and effects 
Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon 
Absolutely unnecessary 
It 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it . 
On johnny knoxville 's stomach 
More than four 
A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
Not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
Visually breathtaking 
Lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
Excellent choice 
A guarantee 
Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and 
Is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
Isolation 
So sloppy , so uneven

This is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism

Unique and quirky 
It 's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
Sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
Is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .

Occasional charms 
An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection 
A future they wo n't much care about 
The six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy . 
Manages to delight without much of a story . 
The importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett 's familiar quotations 
In which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j. 
It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate 
A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
Heartfelt comedy 
Stale material 
Comes to life in the performances . 
The stunt work is top-notch 
Just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting 
If it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
Emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
Unfilmable 
The recording sessions are intriguing 
Enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
Establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape 
Brutally honest and 
Give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice 
A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
A thought-provoking picture . 
End on a positive ( if tragic ) note 
Its delightful cast 
By its art and heart 
All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , 
Just too bratty for sympathy

A group of dedicated artists 
Of ` fatal attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set 
Her film is like a beautiful food entr��e that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
Its target audience talked all the way through it 
Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
Imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
Its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes 
That 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast 
The idea of making kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work 
Gives a performance that is masterly . 
A wonderous accomplishment 
The master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
Aggravating and tedious . 
An oddly fascinating depiction 
So boring 
The lady and the duke surprisingly 
Captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
Which they have been patiently waiting for 
May not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
Ethereal beauty 
Romantic comedy genre 
At once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty 
Amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness 
, rapid-fire delivery 
Feature-length 
An opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` evelyn 
It looks good , sonny , but you missed the point 
Of barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle 
Striking 
At the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
Puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . 
Shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable . 
A delicious and delicately funny look

Genuine laughs 
Some of its repartee is still worth hearing .

The following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film 's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy

Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` saving private ryan '' battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
A lot smarter than your average bond . 
Transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and

Rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
Earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
Eyeballs 
The style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet 's `` house of games '' and last fall 's `` heist '' so much fun 
Infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion 
Skillful and moving 
All the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing 
Has much to recommend it , 
Gives a human face to what 's often discussed in purely abstract terms .

Far too clever by half , howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
With an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable `` formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining 
Built-in audience

Although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service 
... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... the film 's ending has a `` what was it all for ? 
Too many scenes toward the end

A more confused , less interesting and more sloppily

Editing and pompous references

May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .

No worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming .

Losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis 
Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .

Pathetic exploitation film

The triumph

Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . 
Did n't convince me that calvin jr. 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago 's south side 
Laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
Seems hopelessly juvenile . 
A frighteningly fascinating contradiction 
An unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out 
Equally assured 
Have a story and a script

Predictable as the tides 
Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , 
The film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that 
's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama 
Saves 
Uncompromising film 
For making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull

Bracing truth 
Great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s 
Even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
The movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
Of dead-end distaste 
Tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images . 
Good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad 
Young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s the filmmakers could dredge up .

Poor editing , bad bluescreen , 
Lead actress ga? , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile 
Boring

Too much power , not enough puff . 
Nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining

Brainless flibbertigibbet 
Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable

Laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man

Without thrills and a mystery devoid 
Playful but highly studied 
Fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man 
It 's leaden and predictable , and 
Other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas 
Ailments 
Could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
There are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
As good 
Retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images 
Salvation and good intentions 
, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
Does his sly , intricate magic 
Boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing . 
Could n't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen . 
It feels like unrealized potential

Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual 
Beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet

That so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey 
Was the best the contest received 
Is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september 
It finds a nice rhythm . 
It 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil ' bow wow . 
Settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion 
Drains it 
Is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be 
Without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 
This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
Ever so gracefully -- 
Funny and touching 
Is intelligently accomplished 
Has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
Low comedy does n't come much lower .

Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire . 
In the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy 
Strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
Whimsical comedy

That 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l.a. 's show-biz and media 
Different , unusual , even nutty

A maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream 
Dumped a whole lot of plot 
Undisciplined 
Production exists only to capitalize on hopkins ' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book 
Is painfully bad , 
Strange film 
Despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste 
Seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its ��lan , humor , bile , and irony . 
Premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
A kilt

A first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego 
In the way of a too-conscientious adaptation 
There 's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , 
Director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning . 
An action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
The movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . '' 
're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party 
It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; 
Sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
One ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters 
A simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances 
Belongs to nicholson 
And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest .

Perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul 
Nosedive 
We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity

Not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich�� left unsaid .

A biting satire 
Literally 
No big whoop , nothing new to see , 
Tragically 
A small gem from belgium . 
A tendency to sag in certain places 
Simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
Necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
Wind up as glum as mr. de niro 
Little propaganda film 
A great director 
Wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message . 
Become almost as operatic to us 
The picture is so lovely toward the end 
Accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory 
Perfectly 
A bad run 
The performances are amiable and committed , 
Elicits strong performances from his cast 
Brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing

A sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : 
This insufferable movie 
Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious

A sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity 
Nutty cliches

Stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , 
For a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . ' 
It stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast 
Because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans

Dragonfly 
Created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness 
Almost generic 
The goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
It 's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas . 
Entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . 
On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny .

From her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style

Colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical ... the rare sequel that 's better than its predecessor .

'' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
Return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
That celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie 
Making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
Fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious 
Has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters ' lives after the clever credits roll 
Too cynical 
Spooky and subtly 
Into a classic genre 
Is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable 
Up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched 
The plot seems a bit on the skinny side 
Accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
Melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
's something of the ultimate scorsese film 
A more annoying , though 
Loathe him 
Hell , i dunno 
For two directors with far less endearing disabilities 
If mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
Beautiful 
Enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage 
Is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . 
Analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin ' down 
-- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man 
Makes these lives count . 
Trudge out 
All the stronger 
An improvement 
Lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
Constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
Never succeed in really rattling the viewer 
Sub-par 
Bad film 
, the film would be a total washout . 
It would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget 
The bizarre is credible 
Have potential as a cult film , 
None of the charm and little 
To be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme 
Beautifully produced . 
A thoroughly modern maiden 
Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention . 
Born to make 
Gets its greatest play 
Spectacular belly flops 
's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
Cheesy 
Was , as my friend david cross would call it , ` hungry-man portions of bad ' 
A mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant 
The actors are fantastic . 
Has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and 
A caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , 
For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but 
Accurate 
, the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
The music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and 
Faith , love and power 
Their hearts in the right place 
Banality and hypocrisy 
More evil than ever 
Wiseman is patient and 
Manage to keep things interesting . 
Noyce 's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us 
Is a lot more bluster than bite . 
Ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here 
Wo n't be able to look away for a second 
Is top-notch 
Larger than life 
Filmed directly 
Corny sentimentality 
I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
Whimper 
To see a movie with its heart 
Would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
Really wrong with this ricture 
Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
Charm 
's horribly depressing and not very well done 
Is n't exactly endearing 
Amazing breakthrough 
They cheapen the overall effect . 
So sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant 
Irreverent energy 
Stay positive 
Finally seem so impersonal or even shallow 
Without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place 
Some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge 
A sad aristocrat in tattered finery 
Get out your pooper-scoopers 
A superfluous sequel 
Set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to . 
If the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout 
A feel-bad ending 
There 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls ... 
And more entertaining , too . 
A certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work 
An irresistible blend 
In reality it 's one tough rock . 
Captive by mediocrity 
A snore and utter tripe 
Quite possibly the sturdiest example yet 
Schrader examines crane 's decline with unblinking candor . 
Begging for attention 
Are worth the price of admission ... 
Has never been more charming than in about a boy 
It 's impossible to care who wins 
The idiocy 
The characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
Aloof 
A gut punch 
May as well be called `` jar-jar binks : the movie . 
Is priceless 
Torture and self-mutilation 
Is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
Is nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century . 
Loud and offensive , but more often 
( the film ) works 
Multi-layers 
Is entertaining . 
Hit . 
Achieves a level of connection and concern 
Many tense scenes in trapped 
Frustration from those 
Seen in years 
Glinting charm 
I 'm giving it a strong thumbs up 
The act is still charming here . 
An energetic and engaging film 
Is more accurate than anything 
Follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity 
Rekindle the magic of the first film 
To take everyone to since there 's no new `` a christmas carol '' out in the theaters this year 
A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
Cinematic poo . 
Should give `` scratch '' a second look . 
Have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else 
May not be a great piece of filmmaking 
It is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
Personable , amusing 
One-sided theme 
Worth revisiting 
Amusing sidekicks 
Has a sure hand . 
Showing honest emotions . 
Historical truth and realism 
, it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
The reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol 
You 'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter ... '

Deserve better 
Realize , much to our dismay , 
More valuable

A chilling tale of one 
The movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good 
Unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and 
Make this surprisingly decent flick 
The rhapsodic dialogue 
`` unfilmable '' novels 
Way too full of itself 
Not engaging 
Addictive guilty pleasure 
Fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less 
Does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection 
A shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
Figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , 
A movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots 
Dumb gags , anatomical humor , or 
Of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things 
Add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff 
Skip but film buffs should get to know

The biggest disappointments

Infatuated

Sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals 
Being stupid

Of its lurid fiction 
Fire a torpedo through some of clancy 's holes 
Is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition 
To regain his life , his dignity and his music 
Deadly dull 
Any viewer , young or old , 
Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
Ill-conceived and 
Skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise . 
Of this reactionary thriller 
Jolts the laughs 
This cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction 
Steals the show 
It other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap 
Shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls 
By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .

Of inspired humor 
11 times too many 
Delivered with such conviction 
Seen it all before , 
Every cliche we 've come to expect , including the assumption that `` crazy '' people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny 
The universal theme 
Laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists 
... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
We feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick 
Harris is affecting at times 
's a pale imitation . 
Casting excellent latin actors of all ages -- 
Knew what the hell was coming next 
The beat he hears in his soul 
To do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time 
Lovely , sad dance 
That tries to be smart 
The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained . 
Full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes 
Turns in a collectively stellar performance 
Seems timely and important 
Falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy 
A great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments 
Lionize its title character and exploit his anger 
But it does have one saving grace . 
A more credible script , though 
This overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious . 
Gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting ` chops ' 
It 's up to ( watts ) to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
Offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology 
Ruins every single scene he 's in 
Cannon 's confidence and laid-back good spirits 
An intriguing story of maternal instincts and 
Immensely entertaining

Make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom

Good dialogue 
Lighthearted comedy 
Roman polanski may have been born to make

Michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and

Pretty listless 
Filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative 
Is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is

Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short

Started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
Lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
Looks good 
Orchestrating 
Ever knew about generating suspense 
Can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace 
's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer . 
Of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature

Depict the french revolution 
A fascinating character study with laughs 
Is one of the greatest date movies in years . 
The long and eventful spiritual journey 
To believe that a life like this can sound so dull 
Allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk 
Its excellent storytelling 
Likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen 
A revealing look 
Positive ( if tragic ) note 
Flowery 
Change watching such a character , 
Storytelling ability 
Gloom 
Emotional car-wreck 
The auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated 
Is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation 
Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible . 
What debt miramax felt they owed to benigni 
The disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie 's hideous yellow ` do . 
Changing lanes tries for more . 
Bitchy frolic 
Expressively performed 
Mr. rose 's updating works surprisingly well . 
An encouraging effort 
Alarms for duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
How a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture 
No laughs 
High-powered star pedigree 
Without passion or politics 
Being a good documentarian 
While the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles

The corniest

This is a truly , truly bad movie . 
Drama , conflict ,

The only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears 
A scary , action-packed chiller 
The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances 
Mark pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth . 
Relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 
Touch 
Tried hard 
Intimate , unguarded moments 
It borders on facile 
Important political documentary 
A little better than sorcerer 's stone . 
A heroic tale 
Is intriguing 
Never springs to life 
Devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
Is full of charm . 
Own breezy , distracted rhythms 
Ironic cultural satire 
Hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications . 
Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts 
In short 
Devos 
Lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life 
Strong and confident 
If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea 
Is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality . 
Some corny television 
To realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california 
Bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie 
But a very handsomely produced let-down 
Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain 
That transcends culture and race 
Come to care about the main characters 
Self-conscious but often hilarious 
After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
( and probably should have ) 
Other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
Off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
Think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity 
It was , as my friend david cross would call it , ` hungry-man portions of bad ' 
With any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions 
That the movie has no idea of it is serious or not 
-- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles 
Philosophers , not filmmakers 
Is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best . 
The spectacle 
Uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated 
's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful . 
Represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken 
The choppy editing 
That you hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as 
It 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such 
Even sexy 
That will thrill you , touch you and make you 
Acting -- more accurately , it 's moving 
Adaptation is intricately constructed and

Accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film 
Has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story 
Astounding 
May ... work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
Remembering this refreshing visit 
Of expository material 
Its own most damning censure 
The story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
This properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love 
Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and 
One of the best of a growing strain of daring films 
The cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals 
Particular interest 
, despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
Tribute 
Has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end 
Ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon 
Terminally bland , painfully slow and 
Have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
One of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible 
The biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results 
The characters are based on stock clich��s , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility 
Loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves 
Passive-aggressive psychology 
Manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time . 
Stifles creativity and 
... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride . 
Because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel 
Fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite 
For all of us 
Clear-eyed chronicle 
This trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
A manically generous christmas vaudeville . 
So much more 
To have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release 
Richly detailed , deftly executed and 
Though nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature . 
The film is visually dazzling 
Once amusing 
Sex with strangers 
A generic international version of a typical american horror film 
Ugly and mindless 
Meaty subject 
Obvious political insights 
That parker displays in freshening the play 
That it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy 
Would require many sessions on the couch of dr. freud 
As a masterfully made one 
The characters are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films . 
It feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema 
Is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . 
A sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
Has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth 
Very very strong 
This cinderella story does n't have a single surprise up its sleeve . 
Emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema 
Oddly colorful 
Every shot enhances the excellent performances 
To feel good about 
The throes of their first full flush of testosterone 
Jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
Of its oscar nomination 
Both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts 
Sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note 
Very funny , very enjoyable ... 
The proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league 
Of his best-known creation 
Toback 's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
Steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches 
` stoked 
Too much 
... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
Lots of boring talking heads , etc . 
Little less bling-bling 
An original bone 
Good , hard-edged stuff 
Cannon 's confidence and 
Has a film 's title served such dire warning 
A persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title 
Demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
Compelling french psychological drama 
Marinated in clich��s and mawkish dialogue 
Like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life 
Anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s 
Metaphysical 
In the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts 
Do n't blame eddie murphy but 
The redeeming feature 
Kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years . 
Those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
Astronomically bad 
In the front ranks of china 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers 
Feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
To string together enough charming moments to work 
A purpose and a strong pulse 
Sensuality , and 
At least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered 
Young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated 
, it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
Suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener 
This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate . 
Living far too much 
Fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
Riveting performances 
On hammy at times 
Means check it out . 
Desperately wishing you could change tables 
And finely cut diamond 
Convincing one 
The unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans ' story 
Heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and

Work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent 
Emotional gravity 
Flawed ,

A bad movie 
( fincher 's ) camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller . 
Marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- 
It 's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . 
Cusack 's just brilliant in this . 
Hokey 
The shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' ( 1999 )

Bit of piffle . 
The idea of why human beings long for what they do n't have , and how this gets us in trouble 
The mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey . 
Substantial depth 
Drowsy 
Warm and well-told tale 
Stroked , luridly colored , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
Of faith

How ridiculous and money-oriented 
Is quite a vision . 
Immediate inclination to provide a fourth book 
Original film 
Of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , 
Stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time 
To convey a sense of childhood imagination 
For an all-around good time at the movies this summer 
It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . 
Into a laugh-free lecture 
Does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay

Somewhat backhanded 
Epic scope 
In any way demeaning its subjects 
Caught up in an intricate plot 
Worth the journey 
Have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
A full-length classic 
A muddled limp biscuit

Soap-opera 
An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the 
Surprising romance 
Off-puttingly 
Sporadic dips 
Best script 
Und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
Action clich��s 
A companionable couple 
The more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest 
Big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
For the ridicule factor 
Is so prolonged and boring 
The margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel 
Chaos 
Is familiar but enjoyable . 
Been smoother or more confident 
Made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
, purposeless 
Is easily 
Riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character 's gripping humanity 
Enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work 
It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it 's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
Teenage sex comedy

, rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer 
Unsung heroes 
That takes too long to shake 
Of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema 
Could hardly ask for more . 
You shoot something on crummy-looking videotape 
In which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped 
One of the smartest 
Was right to cut 
Has created a beautiful canvas 
's a very very strong `` b + . 
Further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
It fails 
Storytelling is far more appealing 
It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
When it is n't merely offensive 
Is a must for genre fans . 
It never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it 
A more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 
The young stars are too cute ; 
The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
Personal low 
The most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year

Are very expressive .

Not only better 
Of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause 
From this choppy and sloppy affair 
Is smart , not cloying . 
Inquisitive film 
's a spectacular performance - ahem 
Career-defining 
Is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory 
Like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 
Serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure 
Frustrating and 
Canada 's arctic light 
Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
Any scorsese 
Make mel brooks ' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated 
Rich 
But it would be better to wait for the video . 
This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one . 
Of extravagant 
, an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then . 
Choppy and 
, it 'll only put you to sleep . 
Like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit . 
Moonlight mile does n't quite go the distance but 
About movie love 
It could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened 
They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . 
Hugely enjoyable in its own right though 
A bigger-name cast 
Crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies 
Everyone making it 
Soderbergh 's best films 
Coming-of-age film 
Been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson 
Actually manages to bring something new into the mix 
Having fun with it all 
Smeary 
Of making kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work 
Fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy 
The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , 
Terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it 
This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , 
Charged 
Is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later 
To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful 
Satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey 
Self-consciously flashy camera effects 
A dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish 
It skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms. spears 
Cold-hearted 
Existential suffering 
Its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients 
Meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment . 
Would be consigned to the dustbin of history 
A thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story 
The wonderfully lush morvern callar 
The movie is hardly a masterpiece 
Clich��d 
Stays close to the ground 
Hated myself in the morning . 
It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
Know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money 
, yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
Interesting and at times 
Swaggers through his scenes 
Cinematic tone poem 
Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt 
Make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson 
Inherently caustic and 
That it 's too close to real life to make sense 
It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , 
Winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity 
Forgive its mean-spirited second half 
Not funny performers 
Is a lame kiddie flick 
Thoroughly overbearing 
That are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
Two hours of junk 
Successes 
And revolutionary spirit 
Dramatically lackluster 
Remarkably faithful one 
Considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
As good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort . 
No surprises . 
Is oppressively heavy 
Somewhat less 
Are moments of hilarity to be had 
Nutty cliches and far too much dialogue 
Welcomed 
A formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz 
An unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood . 
Washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell 
With some real shocks in store for unwary viewers . 
Live-action cartoon 
Useless actioners 
Uneven dialogue and plot lapses 
A deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident 
Virtually no one 
Still-inestimable contribution 
That not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience 
While we delight in the images 
May sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry 
Fascinating part 
It should have stayed there . 
Smart , funny look 
Walk to remember a niche hit 
Hole-ridden plotting 
Lost in the translation 
Seems twice as long as its 83 minutes 
It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
So it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
Disconnects 
Amazingly evocative 
Weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next 
Have a r��sum�� loaded with credits like `` girl in bar # 3

A rather thin moral 
Misfire that even tunney ca n't save . 
Fully formed

How ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is 
Through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special 
From a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop 
Of a physician who needs to heal himself 
Any way of gripping what its point is 
With humor and poignancy 
Muy loco 
Giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
The variety of tones in spielberg 's work 
Cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion 
No `` waterboy 
Manipulative claptrap

Sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard

That nevertheless touches a few raw nerves 
Of four fine 
Conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible 
Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .

's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
A captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all

The lovable-loser protagonist 
Though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough 
Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
Green men

Feels as if ( there 's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something 
Poor quality 
An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , 
Jazzy score 
Loquacious 
Is prime escapist fare 
The film 's needlessly opaque intro

Much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
Making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be 
Very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive 
A travesty of a transvestite comedy 
Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating 
... is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
Worthy idea 
Have been better off staying on the festival circuit 
Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory 
An intoxicating 
All the earmarks of french cinema at its best 
Also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won . 
Is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing 
Be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds 
To fruition in her sophomore effort 
Super 
Does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
I do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold . 
That strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain 
Would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
Watching `` ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale . 
An interesting and at times captivating 
Will assuredly have their funny bones tickled 
Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , 
The movie sputters 
Suited neither 
Big bloody stew 
From its unsettling prognosis 
, deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
A mournful undercurrent 
Is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout 
A verbal duel between two gifted performers 
Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
This is no `` waterboy ! '' 
Swiftly 
Fairly enjoyable 
A nifty plot line in steven soderbergh 's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination 
Deeply biased , and 
An intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 
Tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . 
The level of an after-school tv special 
The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
Rich tale 
A fascinating profile 
Prepare 
Shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale 
Honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama 
`` far from heaven '' is a masterpiece . 
The mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present 
An interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
Buddy cop comedy 
Horrific

Some serious soul 
The film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea 
Slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation 
The resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book 
Its core 
Standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 
I said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of kung pow

Beautifully animated epic

Overwrought 
Music and life

To listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter 
A witty

Such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating 
What ` blade runner ' would 
A little underconfident 
Cinemantic flair

Have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
Annoying specimen

Dying and loving 
Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
An unsettling sight , and 
The moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path 
Work -- is charming 
The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . 
American and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 
This engaging film 
Not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
`` solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
An affected malaise 
Tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush 
Impeccable study 
Swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements 
That spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
A dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie 
Extremely thorough 
Worth seeing at least once 
Is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : 
Devolves into a laugh-free lecture 
Unforgivingly 
I liked this film a lot ... 
Byron and luther 
The humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence 
The movie equivalent of staring into an open wound 
If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is . 
And , there 's no way you wo n't be talking about the film once you exit the theater . 
That tears welled up in my eyes both times 
That tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship 
By letting you share her one-room world for a while 
Of constant smiles and frequent laughter 
Offended 
Is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually 
Is just a little bit hard to love . 
It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy 
( city ) reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' ( 1999 ) and ` analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
Another boorish movie 
At times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . 
That attracts the young and fit 
Something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality 
Have made it an exhilarating 
Lazy but enjoyable 
The best didacticism 
'm all for that 
In terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself 
Macdowell ... gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she 's ever done . 
Be shallow 
With a `` spy kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
, it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .

Favorite musical 
Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
Another useless recycling of a brutal mid 
Downbeat 
Unfaithful 
Not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer 
Another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype 
A haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
Is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .

Suspenseful spin 
Scant place for the viewer 
Cedar 's 
Utter sincerity 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing 
The predictability of bland comfort food

Feeling like you 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer 
With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
, nothing good can happen 
( hayek ) throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto 
Seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense 
Older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag 
Therefore i know better than to rush to the theater for this one 
Reactionary ideas about women 
Bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction 
Stillborn 
An irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life 's harshness 
The lively appeal of the last kiss 
Featuring an oscar-worthy performance 
Cheap junk 
This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but 
It just seems manufactured to me and artificial 
It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
, hilarious 
This overlong infomercial , 
An intelligent screenplay 
It is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
Executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor 
Had their hearts in the right place . 
Playwriting 101 premise 
Thin notion 
Meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , 
The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence 
That does not move 
Something provocative , rich , and strange 
I 'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent . 
An effective portrait 
I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , 
Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash . 
Send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments 
Loosely speaking , we 're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
Slightly disappointed 
Proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure . 
A must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those 
Could n't keep my attention 
Really earned my indignant , preemptive departure 
Reverent 
His sentimental journey of the heart 
An astoundingly rich film 
I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
Loves them to pieces 
So sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
Goodwill 
Family-friendly comedy 
Before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon 
Is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
Missed the point 
Answered yes , by all means 
As relationships shift , director robert j. siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
The right choices at every turn 
Reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining 
With honesty , insight and humor 
Ambitious films 
Be captivated 
Here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip 
Some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck 
Will likely 
This oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen 
Takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . 
The road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
To make the formula feel fresh 
Is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus 
The most brilliant work 
From the dullest science fiction 
Friendly kick 
Suitable 
I bought this movie 
, folks , it does n't work . 
, there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
Is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona 
From `` promising '' 
A romance this smart 
Fessenden continues to do interesting work 
Will most likely doze off during this one 
A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
There are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , 
The credits roll across the pat ending 
, and totally disorientated 
Who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable 
'd probably turn it off , 
Warm , moving message 
The script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest ` tron ' anderson , seems entirely improvised 
Feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
A script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
An in-depth portrait 
Performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks 
Acquire the fast-paced contemporary society 
Distinctly sub-par 
Mediocre movies 
Most politically audacious films 
If that 's not too glorified a term 
Keeps this pretty watchable , and 
The gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves 
Awesome 
Sun-splashed whites 
Is as bad at it is cruel 
Will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . 
These jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before 
From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line 
Glides gracefully from male persona to female 
World traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something 
Because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
Ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
Pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
Williams ' anarchy gets tiresome 
, it 's icky . 
Far less endearing disabilities 
Lacking in charm and charisma 
Toilet-humor 
Of this tacky nonsense 
A tragedy 
Sluggish 
Mixed up together like a term paper 
While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and 
The screenplay to keep the film entertaining 
Has considerable charm . 
A comedic moment in this romantic comedy 
Simply runs out of ideas 
Reaching the comic heights it obviously desired 
The story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , 
... quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
Everywhere 
This is a superior horror flick . 
( kline 's ) utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who ca n't quite live up to it 
Sneaks up on you and 
Good pace 
Redundant 
It wo n't hold up over the long haul , but 
Appropriately 
Creepy and vague 
Illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters 
's hard to resist his enthusiasm 
The delicious trimmings ... arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
Moving story 
In their recklessness 
Because it was particularly funny 
Appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
Horribly 
Pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year 
A copy of a copy 
Many good ideas 
Is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast 
To reveal his impressively delicate range 
Men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- 
A snore and 
Lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy 
Oft-brilliant 
One of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie ,

A younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy

Should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . 
Unexpected ways , touching 
Trouble every day is a success in some sense , 
Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death 
Fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships 
All-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor . 
If `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time 
Little film noir organized crime story 
A crowdpleaser 
, it 's the worst movie i 've seen this summer 
Realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch 
Its ultimate demise 
The music makes a nice album 
New , or inventive , journey 
Its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline 
Fan to appreciate scratch 
A certain ambition 
That his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace 
A delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
Law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey 
Un-bear-able 
A small movie with a big impact 
Chilling , and affecting study 
It 's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously . 
The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin 
A hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates 
Numbness 
It 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it 
That everlasting conundrum 
Is fine 
Ravishing waif 
The film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public 
Feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment 
Is the action as gripping 
It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not 
The pitch-perfect forster

By the time it 's done with us , mira nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , 
That reaches across time and distance 
As beautiful , desirable , even delectable 
Brilliantly constructed work 
The better film 's ability to make its subject interesting to those who are n't part of its supposed target audience 
The gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and 
That really gives the film its oomph 
Limpid and 
Force you to scratch a hole in your head 
Librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized 
Much humor 
To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
Two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance 
A flick about our infantilized culture that is n't entirely infantile . 
Off the page , and for the memorable character creations 
Drumline ' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
Dog 
An exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out 
Cool crime movie 
Establishes a wonderfully creepy mood 
Dullest tangents 
Is needed to live a rich and full life 
By on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company 
This flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
To say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense 
( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) 
Gets the job done . 
Sharp writing 
Depressed 
Much better 
Is actually funny without hitting below the belt 
Things that elevate `` glory '' above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall 
Time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge 
Be a different kind of film 
While centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
A very charming and funny movie . 
With vibrant charm 
A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family 
A film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics 
Outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and 
Manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
Stephen earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
Insightful discourse 
To set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years 
It 's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong 
Surprisingly funny movie 
A creaky `` pretty woman '' 
Numbness . 
Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . 
It becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
Kids 
Buried , drowned and 
Remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre 
Heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment 
Expert comic timing 
The broiling sun for a good three days 
Necessary and timely 
It makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i 've had in a while . 
The film itself is small and shriveled 
Of emotional comfort 
Care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories 
Crafted a deceptively casual ode 
, but solidly entertaining 
I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . 
The film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching 
Mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar 
Masterful 
There are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .

Minor film 
Of chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries 
Has little insight 
With little logic or continuity 
Its own action is n't very effective 
Be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother 
If a big musical number like ` praise the lord , he 's the god of second chances ' does n't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . 
It takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going 
Undoubtedly 
( clooney 's ) debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh 
Sweet , funny , charming 
You leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
Inferior level 
Just a string 
Has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point 
How low brow

Warmth to go around , with music and laughter and 
The start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way 
Of great charm , generosity and diplomacy 
Little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up 
Sodden 
Cox creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky 's diaries .

Keen 
Foolish 
Idiotically 
Would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative 
Real narrative logic 
Nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone 
Powerful drama 
Muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through 
A trip 
Does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution 
Create a complex , unpredictable character 
Engaging and exciting narrative 
Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito 's way .

Stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner 
Great idea 
Psychological case study 
Yet another visit 
It almost loses what made you love it 
Uncomfortably real 
Achieves ultimate insignificance 
That extravagantly redeems it 
It 's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away . 
Of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions 
It goes awry in the final 30 minutes 
Got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile

Nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals 
Best part ' of the movie 
A guiltless film 
While this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship 's heart 
... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
Where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves 
Entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed 
As a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
Will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
Dry humor 
Is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while 
Because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Slightly pokey

Its heartfelt concern about north korea 's recent past and south korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight 
While it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight . 
Plays out like a flimsy excuse

That rare animal 
One-of-a-kind

This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
Broomfield is energized by volletta wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .

Most excruciating 86 minutes 
The film , while not exactly assured in its execution , 
Is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing 
No explanation or even plot relevance 
You can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
A strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet . 
So intimate and sensual and funny and 
One that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence

Is a just a waste 
Wind up using them as punching bags 
Pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate 
Spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes 
Pitch-perfect 
The unfulfilling , incongruous 
... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time 
The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
Accept it as life and go with its flow 
Sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
Embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence 
Cinematic knack 
Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks

Schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms. mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
Vibrant 
Captures both the beauty of the land and the people 
It accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition 
The annoying score 
In no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy 
Although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america . 
Show-stoppingly hilarious , but 
Can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored 
An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
Pretty tattered 
Get out 
Particularly memorable 
I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture 
Is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
Rob schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines

A small , personal film 
Geriatric dirty harry 
This smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life

Only half-an-hour long or 
Taking the easy hollywood road 
Prepackaged 
Full of elaborate and twisted characters 
Paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
Such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
Mediocre horror film 
Is better than you might think . 
Fine effort 
Through than in most ` right-thinking ' films 
Snoozer 
's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive 
Between flaccid satire and what 
The film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
Could have been crisper and punchier , but 
Effects that are more silly than scary 
From accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
Worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
Intense and engrossing head-trip 
Is a big time stinker .

Buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly

Rarity 
Tolerate leon barlow 
This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
Is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels 
Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... 
Watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain 
Old-fashioned , occasionally charming 
Hollowness 
To enjoy good trash every now and then 
The laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won 
To unexpected heights 
That 's low on both suspense and payoff 
Conjure proper respect 
I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
Enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit 
Quite unengaging 
Every sequel you skip 
Gently comic even as the film breaks your heart 
Made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others 
Its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors 
Just offensive 
The soul of a man in pain 
Of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters 
The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy . 
Whose derring-do puts the x into the games 
Low , very low , very very low 
Of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects 
Falls into the trap of pretention almost every time 
Is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture 
As janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
Little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film 
Virulently unpleasant excuse 
Full of cheesy dialogue ,

Both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others . 
Absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes 
Beyond-lame 
Classical actress 
Banal in its message and the choice of material 
Irrational , long-suffering but cruel 
Masochistic 
It offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 
Earnest homage 
The stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller 
Have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
Charming , funny and beautifully crafted import 
Drab wannabe

That will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why 
If s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's ( and its makers ' ) credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves 
Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
It gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
Amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . ''

Well , jason 's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) .

Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture 
Playfully profound ... and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
Bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension 
Into heaven 
What 's missing 
Is often exquisite 
While the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich�� 
Inappropriate 
A terrific b movie -- 
Has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
An uncomfortable movie , 
Decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
A story of dramatic enlightenment 
Queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
Distinctly minor 
As does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter 
The film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes 
Stinks 
If only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks

Yawner . 
A smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn 
Genius 
Spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together 
The film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties 
Alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
Slow , predictable and 
Is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad 's wallet 
That my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold 
Preachy and 
's unfortunate 
Because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact 
While solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
Not counting a few gross-out comedies i 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
10 minutes into the film you 'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
By a self-indulgent script 
Often-funny comedy 
Is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
Proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls 
Rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge

As france 's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace 
Technically sophisticated in the worst way

For devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
Utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story 
A lump of play-doh

Really won my heart 
To see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway 
As a reverie about memory and regret 
Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and

Charming and funny 
Worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s

Too stupid 
For the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers 
Was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel 
Like sitting in a downtown caf�� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables 
Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series 
So insanely dysfunctional 
Nice , light treat 
Intimate and universal cinema 
Incredibly captivating and 
A penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
What the hell was coming next 
Is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action 
An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .

Are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
'd bother watching past the second commercial break 
Tasty morsels 
Suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length 
Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
Think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world 's most generic rock star .

Drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
Is as generic as its title 
This bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty .

The performances are often engaging 
A retread story , bad writing , and

The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short

A fluid , no-nonsense authority 
It 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions 
Why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's hollywood 
Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
A fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor 
Makes it worth a recommendation 
Angst-ridden 
A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with

Packed with just as much intelligence as action 
Delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle 
The best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years 
Does not make for much of a movie . 
Far less sophisticated 
An awful sour taste 
Is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato 
Seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
I thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and

A relentlessly globalizing world 
Well done , but slow

Writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin 
There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but 
Is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive 
Truly bad 
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping 
This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain 
A good human being 
Poverty 
Just such a dungpile 
This new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity 
Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience . 
To mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved 
Flamboyant style 
Have done a fine job of updating white 's dry wit to a new age . 
... an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .

Brave and challenging 
Be considered a funny little film 
Gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
Stilted and unconvincing 
This alleged psychological thriller 
Veered off too far into the exxon zone , and 
Imbued with passion and attitude 
Almost seems like a documentary in the way 
Its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor 
In tight pants and big tits 
True to its animatronic roots : 
When ( reno ) lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w. bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al. , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .

The reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
Is a disaster . 
Squirts the screen in ` warm water under a red bridge '

Are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance 
It 's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke .

Exploitative for the art houses and too cynical 
The city 's old-world charm 
To sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing 
Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants 
, ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
Befuddled in its characterizations 
Of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery 
Vibrantly colored 
Even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside

Will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
Is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
A gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , 
Wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor 
Offers rare insight 
No , it 's not as single-minded as john carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels 
Past his prime 
It is a hilarious place to visit 
Has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel

Has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director 
Spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh 
As comedic spotlights go , notorious c.h.o. hits all the verbal marks it should . 
In this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen 
It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
A culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
Every joke is repeated at least 
Makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian

A cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history 
As an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
The film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying 
The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .

Heavy on the atmospheric weirdness

Barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
A powerful performance 
Even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient 
It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting

Enthusiasm 
The story together frustrating difficult 
There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all 
A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
Slimed in the name of high art 
Idol 's 
Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .

Relegated 
E.t. works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet .

Flickering reminders of the ties that bind us 
Director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon 
Has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
It begins to fade from memory 
A sudden lunch rush 
One hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , 
A sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair 
Combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise 
Not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images 
Repulsive and depressing 
Lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' ( 1999 ) and ` analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year 
Watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves 
Intense experience 
Heedless 
Little uneven 
Sealed with a kiss 
Very ugly 
Why this project was undertaken 
The mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and 
Halfhearted 
Dilutes the pleasure of watching them 
The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and 
Can get your money back 
This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
The most entertaining monster movies in ages 
And well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics 
's rare 
Gets vivid performances from her cast 
The preachy 
Lovingly 
A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it 's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 
It introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers 
Brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she 's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 
Confusion and 
Of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes 
The power of this movie 
Too immature and unappealing to care about 
-- she 's pretty and she can act -- 
Proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes . 
Nice to see piscopo again after all these years 
A quiet , disquieting triumph . 
In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year . 
Self-discovery 
It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do . 
Knockoff . 
All the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore 
Odd , rapt spell 
But it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , 
A master of shadow , quietude , and room noise 
Amazing finesse 
No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
Smug and convoluted action-comedy that 
Never fails to entertain 
The national lampoon film franchise , 
Of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up 
You liked the previous movies in the series 
If argento 's hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve 
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture 
Is really , really stupid . 
Underdone 
To hear the full story of jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it 
Shallow and dim-witted 
Despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
The powerful 
Kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
Than bad 
It is flawed 
Anyone in his right mind would want to see the it 
Is one carried by a strong sense of humanism 
This loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
Antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories 
A laundry list of minor shortcomings 
Much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature 
Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
Lack contrast , 
The supernatural trappings only obscure the message 
The april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
Gently humorous and touching . 
The mess that is world traveler 
A film of quiet power 
Compelling character 
With an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi 's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . 
Ironically killer soundtrack 
No way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy 
The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title . 
An unruly adolescent boy 
An undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
Does little here 
Contemplative 
Doze off thirty minutes into the film 
Embodies the transformation of his character completely 
An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
Making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters 
In all its strange quirks 
The seemingly irreconcilable situation 
's a pale imitation 
'd want to watch if you only had a week to live 
Useless movie 
... flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
, we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized . 
Than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album 
A zippy jazzy score 
( a ) stale retread of the '53 original 
, charming and quirky 
It is thought-provoking . 
In cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j. 
Directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
Know the picture is in trouble . 
This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion . 
A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity . 
The film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals 
Damaged-goods 
What 's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children . 
Curious about each other against all odds 
Mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot 
Lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter 
's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
Is : ` scooby ' do n't 
No new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
Ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story 
With a pleasing verisimilitude 
The dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities 
Achingly human 
It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
A sun-drenched masterpiece 
An american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp 
A contemptible imitator starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni 
A provocateur 
What ( denis ) accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film 
Hard , cold effect 
His inspiration 
Some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of jordan 
A sea of visual and verbal clich��s 
The characters seem one-dimensional 
Of the recent hollywood trip tripe 
The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed 
Drowned out by director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap 
Cho 's latest comic set is n't as sharp or as fresh as i 'm the one that i want ... but it 's still damn funny stuff 
Wo n't score points for political correctness 
Does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
To laugh at how bad 
Enchanting ... 
It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . 
Who cares ? 
A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
To do a little fleeing of its own 
The heart and soul of cinema 
Repulsive 
, mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
A straight-to-video movie 
Is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation 
Clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
Charming than in about a boy 
Like any of these despicable characters 
You have left the theater 
With her small , intelligent eyes 
The film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
That this film was n't as bad as i thought it was going to be 
Fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people 
Profound humanity 
The chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms ... is a nonstop hoot . 
As tryingly as the title 
A hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza 
If disney 's cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes . 
It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious . 
A rich tale of our times 
, imaginative filmmaking 
Crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
Blue crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
Blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
An enormously entertaining movie 
A surprisingly charming and even witty match 
Crisp storytelling 
Rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor 
That chin 's film serves up with style and empathy 
Muted freak-out 
Earns extra points 
A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . 
Particular talents 
Be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly 
It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter 
Rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed 
Entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch 
's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage 
Is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
To great artistic significance 
Little emotional resonance 
Revelatory and 
An average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
Surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia 
Are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile 
, pretty and gifted , it really won my heart 
Lessen the overall impact the movie could have had 
It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and 
Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theaters 
Has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie 
, the basic plot of `` lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
Go wrong 
While the story 's undeniably hard to follow , iwai 's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
Wanted to leave 
The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
's flawed and brilliant 
That the film 's length becomes a part of its fun 
Argentinian thriller 
Almost peerlessly unsettling . 
To some truly excellent sequences 
Does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up 
Not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . ' 
In its own simplicity 
Satisfies 
It seems as if each watered down the version of the one before

Captivatingly

A story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously .

You 're an absolute raving star wars junkie 
A movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you 've actually spent time living in another community . 
Very well-meaning movie ,

Australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them .

A gorgeously strange movie ,

Been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around 
Motivated by nothing 
The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , 
Blow it off the screen 
's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
As pedestrian as they come . 
The climactic burst of violence 
Want my money back 
Let this morph into a typical romantic triangle 
Moldering pile 
Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
That even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside 
A long shot 
An effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
Very least 
Gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry .

My big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year 
There 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller 
's plenty to offend everyone ... 
From the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- 
It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
That really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages 
Smart , funny , subtle , and resonant 
No quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2

A positively thrilling combination

Only a genius 
Flamboyant female comics

Drama , suspense , revenge , and romance

Strolls 
Upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
It is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction 
Is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull 
Manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal 
Become smug or sanctimonious 
I do n't mean that in a good way 
Written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there 's something about mary co-writer ed decter .

Soderbergh 's best films , `` erin brockovich , '' `` out of sight '' and 
Low-rent retread 
Somewhat tired 
Enough sweet and 
Crude and unrelentingly exploitative 
Starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true 
... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and 
Leaves a lot to be desired 
'll cheer . 
Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens . 
Stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . 
Candid 
The double-cross that made mamet 's `` house of games '' and last fall 's `` heist '' so much fun 
Memorable performances 
Are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary 
Ugly , irritating 
Was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention 
Enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode 
's sweet . 
It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
Fluffy 
In venice 
An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience 
It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
Surprisingly insightful 
Will keep them awake 
Does not make for much of a movie 
In jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience 
A potentially sudsy set-up 
A fascinating case study of flower-power liberation 
Of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest 
Is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
, resonant gem 
An abyss of clich��s , depression and bad alternative music 
For its rather slow beginning 
To suspense thriller 
The film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed . 
Harrowing and uplifting 
The humor dwindles . 
Hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated 
Fluffy and disposible . 
Something of the ultimate scorsese film 
Of the guru who helped 
Birot 's 
In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history 
Is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc 's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
Offbeat humor , amusing characters , 
To place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence 
Extremely flat 
Most original american productions 
Quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
Make you think about existential suffering 
Directing with a sure and measured hand 
Left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity 
Sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama 
, unlikable characters 
A seriously bad film with seriously 
The screen -- loud , violent and mindless 
Just as rewarding 
Treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you 're a struggling nobody . 
Remind one of a really solid woody allen film 
First made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
But believe it or not , it 's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i 've seen . 
This unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work 
Fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time 
In the end , there is n't much to it . 
All awkward , static 
's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
Grant is n't cary and bullock is n't katherine . 
Does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events 
It does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds 
The gift of tears 
A bad name 
As wonderful on the big screen 
This emotional car-wreck 
A gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable 
On ugly digital video 
High-concept scenario 
That it 's hard not to be carried away 
Could n't come up with a better script . 
Argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door 
With a fresh point of view 
Slow , predictable and not very amusing 
's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
Juvenile camera movements 
Of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape 
Remake sleepless in seattle again and again 
That kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about 
Virtually no understanding 
, actor raymond j. barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , 
All give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy 
The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
Dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
Of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man 
With `` ichi the killer '' , takashi miike , japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman ... 
Final act 
Girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls 
Acceptable 
Imaginatively mixed cast 
Diverting and modest 
Are mean giggles and pulchritude . 
Is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style 
Virtuoso 
The obvious cliches 
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
Burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
The drama that gives added clout to this doc 
Vile enough 
Real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve 
Separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd 
Is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
This nervy oddity , like modern art 
Clever and unexpected 
Puts to rest any thought that the german film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food . 
Should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
Technically proficient 
Even worse than its title 
There 's ) quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
This uncharismatically 
Stronger 
's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
Impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant

Put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year 
Surprisingly brilliant 
A funny little film 
A bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and 
Certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . 
The direction is intelligently accomplished 
Disney 's 1937 breakthrough 
Titillating material 
Can handle 
's so striking about jolie 's performance 
Peppered with false starts 
Michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something 
A cheap thriller , a dumb comedy 
Paul bettany is cool . 
Shamelessly manipulative 
A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline 
A cool event 
, pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material . 
An inspiring tale 
I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , 
A preposterous , prurient whodunit 
Energetic , extreme-sports adventure 
The best rock 
Backed by sheer nerve 
's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after 
Avoiding eye contact and 
Too fast 
Richly resonant work 
Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake 
Much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance 
Bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie ... is , also , frequently hilarious . 
His dead mother 
-- that the ` true story ' by which all the queen 's men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen . 
Is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal 
To be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script 
Is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
Almost impossible 
Exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision 
Unconcerned 
Unstinting 
There 's nothing exactly wrong here 
In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms. shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .

The tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , ` hungry-man portions of bad ' 
Spectacle and pacing 
This engaging mix of love and bloodletting 
Psychologically unpersuasive 
It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
, he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy 
Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg 's adaptation of mary gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
Targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
The surprise ending 
Filmed more irresistibly than in ` baran 
's muy loco , but no more ridiculous 
The animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst . 
With a tawdry b-movie scum 
Smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
A really good premise 
Whirlwind 
Full of sex , drugs and rock 
`` sorority boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
Artistic significance 
A crass and insulting homage 
's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films 
Is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
Sitting through dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
Of a predictable outcome and a screenplay 
Like reading a research paper 
Actually pulling it off 
Proud warrior 
's crafty , energetic and smart 
Groaners 
One senses 
Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab 
Is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful 
Is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
Of her life with the imagery in her paintings 
Sad sack 
Recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters 
Daft by half ... but 
Its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity 
For once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
Preciousness 
Is also a work of deft and subtle poetry 
Plotless collection of moronic stunts 
Plain old blarney 
Has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
One of the best looking and stylish 
Important , original talent 
To the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking 
The cast is top-notch and 
Give what may be the performances of their careers . 
A comedic moment 
Cruelty and suffering 
Old-fashioned , occasionally charming and 
She can act 
Gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks 
Without overdoing it 
Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
It 's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
Well-made but mush-hearted . 
That even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention 
Of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade 
Lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories 
Inventive screenplay 
Of human frailty fascinates 
Gets under our skin and 
Is not as well-conceived as either of those films 
Returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s 
A huge amount of the credit for the film 
During a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action 
Good man 
Linking a halfwit plot 
It is that it does n't give a damn . 
An impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and 
The magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki 's spirited away survives intact in bv 's re-voiced version . 
Sub-formulaic slap 
The group 's playful spark of nonconformity 
Of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
Out-sized 
Manner and flamboyant style 
Also rocks . 
Is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation . 
Fits the bill 
Waste their time on it 
An easy film 
Inventive moments 
Is a bomb 
An adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle 
One of the most unpleasant things the studio 
Engaging and unpredictable character pieces 
Of the theater feeling 
Rather bland 
There are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys .

Chronically mixed signals

In a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell 
That the movie has no idea of it is serious 
The best silly horror movies 
Its flaws 
Watching this waste of time 
Without being shrill 
Interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and 
Disappointingly generic 
Well enough 
Aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms. mirren , who did ) 
The film is insightful about kissinger 's background and history . 
, lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , 
Needed so badly but what is virtually absent 
Is merely a charmless witch 
's too harsh 
So , i trust 
Flashes of mordant humor 
Long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time 
Swallow its absurdities and crudities 
Wild ride 
A literary detective story is still a detective story 
Did n't laugh . 
Cowardly 
Like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining

Impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats 
Give credit to affleck 
Poor fit 
Can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
A wonderful thing 
Strong and convincing performances 
Of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor 
Grenade 
Disgusting source material 
Parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 
That reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' pg-13 rating 
, numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday 
Rendered in as flat 
Kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design 
More good than great 
Gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since `` saving private ryan '' 
Corny 
Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company . 
A dream is a wish your heart makes 
, you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . 
Those visual in-jokes 
's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh 
Has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
Missing from it 
Muddy psychological thriller 
You forget you 've been to the movies . 
Then ends with a whimper 
In the thrill of the company 's astonishing growth 
Held my interest

The film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
Ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast .

The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that 
Deadeningly drawn-out 
You pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead 
The adrenaline jolt 
Manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
Does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
The massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
The screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him ... there is never really a true `` us '' versus `` them ''

Sustains a higher plateau with bullock 's memorable first interrogation of gosling 
Worst titles 
The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... it 's a pity that ( nelson 's ) achievement does n't match his ambition 
Crudely literal 
Revolting 
The story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it 's based upon 
Very moving and revelatory 
It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long . 
Perfectly pitched 
A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters 
Smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .

A playful iranian parable 
I have returned from the beyond to warn you : 
A technological exercise that lacks juice and delight 
A worthwhile documentary , whether you 're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits 
The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
You wo n't be able to look away for a second 
Merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew 
Effecting change and inspiring hope 
A compelling look at a young woman 's tragic odyssey 
Amuse or entertain 
May not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces 
Because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope 
In almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off 
Is to say that it does n't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world 
The best of the swashbucklers

From bland actors 
The book 's irreverent energy , 
The movie is in a class by itself 
Updating works surprisingly well 
Spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . 
, mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
An action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd 
A bad premise 
Intellect and feeling 
Preferable 
Third act miscalculation 
We do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
A couple of things that elevate `` glory '' above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall 
Redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs 
No charm 
Clumsily manufactured exploitation flick 
Insufferably naive 
Looks and feels tired . 
One only a true believer could relish

Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls '' and last year 's `` rollerball 
Quietly engaging . 
It uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
Perfectly serviceable and

Transforms this story about love and culture 
This little-known story of native americans and 
Argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
Seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up 
Impressed with its own solemn insights 
Jagged , 
Intelligent humor 
Succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory 
Decent popcorn adventure 
Such a big job 
To a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
Excruciatingly 
Standing by yourself is haunting ... ( it 's ) what punk rock music used to be , and what the video medium could use more of : spirit , perception , conviction . 
It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , 
We feel as if we 're seeing something purer than the real thing 
In its attempts 
Stylistic 
Was so endlessly

Me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . 
Needlessly 
Besson 's high-profile name 
The boho art-house crowd 
A coherent rhythm 
That falls far short 
The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
Chases for an hour and then 
Sophisticated 
's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ... 
Pete 's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
Delight your senses 
Aimlessly and unsuccessfully 
Thoughtful war films 
Suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness

Laugh-out-loud lunacy 
Who makes martha enormously endearing

Bad things 
It was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second

Toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it 's hard not to be carried away 
Anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny

Overly old-fashioned

Colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
, you 'll still be glued to the screen . 
Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , 
To cram too many ingredients into one small pot 
And for all the wrong reasons besides . 
Crime expertly 
Dream 
Although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
Wretched movie 
It is scott 's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
Marred beyond redemption

Ice age wo n't drop your jaw 
Steamy 
( carvey 's ) characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark 
Idealism american 
Can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again 
Phenomenal 
Black-and-white and unrealistic . 
A clever script 
In the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo 
This is n't a movie 
Works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun . 
, profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen . 
Carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract 
It 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message 
There 's already been too many of these films ... 
American action-adventure buffs 
Succeeds 
Is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships 
One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
Hard , endearing , caring , 
The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
Is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats 
The best star trek movie 
Satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified 
, uneventful 
It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) 
Remember it . 
The performances of their careers 
's a talking head documentary , but a great one 
, the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
Leaden script 
That the film never feels derivative 
Toward maximum comfort and familiarity 
Wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours 
Average kid-empowerment fantasy 
Scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
Are an absolute joy .

Makes it to the boiling point 
That jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend . 
So stilted and unconvincing 
Wonderful , ghastly film 
Of the highest and the performances 
Can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
It is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point 
Little more than punishment 
He does best 
Great to look at 
The absence of narrative continuity 
A moving tale of love and destruction 
A much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
Sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film 
's more enjoyable than i expected , 
, dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot 
Everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
Slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth 
An intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling 
, i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
Reel in when we should be playing out 
Seem appealing 
Beautifully shot 
's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
Of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels 
It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie 
Strange it is , but delightfully so . 
Has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s 
Serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting 
Pleasant but not 
Who handily makes the move from pleasing 
Torments and angst 
Works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet 
Is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , 
Saccharine genre 
High points to keep this from being a complete waste of time 
The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
Genuinely 
-- casting excellent latin actors of all ages -- 
Does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
A strangely 
Abundant humanism 
Is the heart and soul of cinema 
To seek and strike just the right tone 
It 's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son 's room . 
Poorly structured 
`` spider-man '' certainly 
What 's so striking about jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
Sounds promising 
Then again , i hate myself most mornings . 
A slice of counterculture 
Unrelentingly grim 
Signals director rick famuyiwa 's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise 
The imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
Also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives 
Has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavors and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book . 
Feast 
Cleverly captures the dry wit that 's so prevalent on the rock 
Glorious spectacle 
Picked me up , swung me around 
The off-center humor is a constant 
Staged violence overshadows everything , 
Remarkable serenity and discipline 
The ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or 
Attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe 
Started with a great premise 
Reaches across time and distance 
There 's an admirable rigor to jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending 
If you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes

Will not be for much longer 
An hour and a half of joyful solo performance 
The sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre 
Kind 
Is a towering siren . 
The too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and 
Gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust 
The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . 
, like max rothman 's future , does not work . 
It all the more compelling 
Bouncy score 
Cheery and 
Want to smash its face in 
For that sense of openness , the little surprises 
The human story is pushed to one side 
Highly uneven and 
Kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
Fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we 're seeing something purer than the real thing 
Of drooling idiots 
Poorly executed comedy . 
Really bad blair witch project 
Leaves him shooting blanks 
Barely shocking , barely interesting and most 
Formidable 
A ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy 
The viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything 
It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
That it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
Realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject 
Is solid 
Particularly well made 
By a master 
Of deja vu 
At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
Hollow , self-indulgent , and 
, not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , 
A great cast and 
Richly entertaining and suggestive 
Drawing flavorful performances 
After one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it 's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 
To avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
To an imitation movie 
Deeply satisfying 
That if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labeled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' 
Yawning 
What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
A terrible movie

Self-mocking ,

Devastated by war , famine and poverty and 
Nice piece 
The plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise 
This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
Is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
An achingly enthralling premise , 
Susceptible to blue hilarity , 
Beautiful than either of those films

A good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera 
Best war movies 
Fan 
My problem with the movie 's final half hour 
Hitting your head 
Fierce 
Toothless dog 
Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
A forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome 
Gorgeous to look at 
Is both contrived and cliched 
Maximum comfort and familiarity 
Endlessly superficial . 
An uncomfortable experience , but 
Plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder 
Worst film 
Having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything 
But the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
Especially well-executed 
K-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
Absorbing 
S1m0ne 's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . 
Thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments 
But it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half 
It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . 
Ludicrous film 
Kicking undead *** 
, vibrant introduction 
The good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable 
Bowling for columbine '' remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film ... 
A dashing and absorbing outing with one of france 's most inventive directors . 
Chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
On opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work 
Highest production values 
Horse feathers 
A game supporting cast 
Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
Of a culture in conflict 
Inexcusable 
Despite its promising cast of characters 
Any way demeaning its subjects 
To losing my lunch 
Clumsily 
I liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
That the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen 
That will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches 
Slippery self-promoter 
A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions . 
Greatest play 
S&m 
A sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout 
Swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . 
Plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film 
Left me behind 
Decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set 
, mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
As looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
Can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
A really special walk 
Tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
Nair 's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
Pretty good team 
A clear-eyed portrait 
, k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
Sexy 
The grandkids or the grandparents 
Do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this 
Most deceptively amusing 
Taken seriously 
Largely improvised 
Zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
Film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
, that 's a liability . 
A funny and touching film that is gorgeously 
The chocolate factory without charlie . 
Most romantic 
We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
Promise 
Hilarious adventure 
Keeps this pretty watchable 
The kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean 
He 's made at least one damn fine horror movie 
Chokes 
If villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
Rehashes several old themes 
Stuffy and pretentious 
Slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot 
Overplayed and exaggerated 
Is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow 
To films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix 
Dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals 
More of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with 
More experimental 
Even betters it 
Well-written and occasionally challenging 
's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics ) 
A matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games 
One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning 
New zealand coming-of-age movie 
The film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
Fare , with enough 
What ?!? 
... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ... 
With its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes 
Directed but terminally cute drama . 
Superbly 
's betting her third feature will be something to behold 
Eccentric and good-naturedly 
Is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once . 
So much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles 
A fairly revealing study 
And crudely literal 
Continues . 
Sounding 
A striking style 
Over and over again . 
Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve 
Hormonal melodrama 
It looks good , but it is essentially empty 
Entirely persuasive 
Makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness 
In praise of love 
One very funny joke and a few other decent ones 
Surrounded by open windows 
Grace this deeply touching melodrama . 
Of the best inside-show-biz 
An important director 
Juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre 
Earned my indignant , preemptive departure 
An intimate contemplation of two marvelously 
More smarts 
Becomes claustrophobic 
Rescue adrian lyne 's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing 
Intelligent romantic thriller 
As a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
Immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and 
, about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
Very shapable but largely unfulfilling present 
Prejudice 
One relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time 
Seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart 
Do no wrong with jason x. 
Great script 
Is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting . 
Has its heart 
This real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
She 's pretty 
And social commentary 
Bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
The spirits of these young women 
Debilitating 
Dumb fart jokes 
Eloquence 
The gutless direction by laurice guillen 
It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing 
Much funnier film 
Will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone 
Escape 
To build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe 
Friendship , love 
Dazzle 
: the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 
The film is saved from are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
Work of extraordinary journalism 
Sad nonsense , this . 
The characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor 
Present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america ... sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight 
I loved on first sight and , even more important , 
That works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing 
Shimmers with it 
The cheesiest 
In part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor 
It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but 
Moonlight mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
An affectionately goofy satire 
Indoors in formal settings with motionless characters 
's pauly shore awful 
Matches about it . 
Is sadly heightened by current world events 
A major-league leading lady 
A taut , sobering film . 
Fits into a classic genre 
Corpse 
's as good as you remember . 
Goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
Bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid 
Unbalanced 
Message resonate 
That goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling 
Population 
More disciplined grade-grubbers 
Seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves 
Too textbook to intrigue 
Unforced naturalism 
Appear avant-garde 
At least a few good ideas 
Technically proficient and without the pop-up comments 
Completely lacking in chills 
's still a rollicking good time for the most part 
Splendid meal 
Is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost 
, mr. rose 's updating works surprisingly well . 
A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait 
In this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted 
Solid , spooky 
Does n't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
That its visual imagination is breathtaking 
Insightful writer/director 
Is definitely worth 
Provided his own broadside 
Sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry 
Herzog simply runs out of ideas and 
Raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream 
It 's all about anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
Dark , funny humor 
Flat-out amusing 
, sweet ` evelyn 
Thoughtless 
Well-balanced fashion 
To commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded 
This in the right frame of mind 
Is well-crafted 
Great film 
Plays like a bad soap opera 
An exhilarating new interpretation 
Fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs 
This film biggest problem 
Shame on writer/director vicente aranda 
Spiced with humor ( ' i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) 
, circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
Definitive 
Here lacks considerable brio . 
Sometimes endearing 
Its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh 
Achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself 
Restrictive 
Spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
Is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
Magic and is enjoyable family fare 
Are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours 
All about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time 
Cheap hysterics 
With the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling 
Numb 
Narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute 
Tries its best 
To tiresome jargon 
Read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema . 
Avoids the cartoonish clich��s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type 
Of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life 
The light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie 
Will be pleased to discover that tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus . 
Want to slap it 
A well loved classic 
When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons 
It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , 
A bit anachronistic 
Fair amount 
Effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese 
George clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . 
Regard 
Ridiculous 
Is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses 
It 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started 
An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas 
Half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget 
Vintage looney tunes 
's refreshing to see a romance this smart 
Unexpected heights 
The strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife . 
Us plenty of sturm 
Comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile 
Prevents 
Unoriginal terms 
From fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew 
To its ultimate demise 
Forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
Efficient , suitably anonymous chiller 
Holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin . 
Of the family vacation 
A thoughtful examination 
Than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama 
Art house pretension . 
Leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless 
While we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii . 
Will linger long after this film has ended 
, knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
An actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings 
You would n't want to live waydowntown 
Awful movie 
However , almost makes this movie worth seeing . 
She 's appealingly manic and energetic . 
A geriatric 
Tear-drenched quicksand 
Wonderful 
The slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , 
An unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and 
, it gets to you . 
Clueless 
Is well worthwhile 
Even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
Is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful 
Of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining 
Ice cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
Limited chemistry 
Attractive and 
Nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro 's right-hand goombah . 
Serene 
Sheerly beautiful 
; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
Feel contradictory things 
Is nothing to sneeze at these days 
Deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese 
Aimlessly and 
Study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture 
A charming , banter-filled comedy 
Although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
A buoyant , expressive flow of images 
The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
Was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout 
Much better mother-daughter tale 
, but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel 
That you 'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it 
Above-average 
Working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli 
Makes the clothes 
, the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
Far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat 
's so badly made on every level that i 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it 
The mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t. 
Rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday 
Is a masterpiece . 
Formulaic and stilted 
A true believer 
's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such 
Viva le 
The more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
Might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares 
In a way that verges on the amateurish 
A straightforward , emotionally honest manner 
Geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity 
Stare and sniffle 
Saving 
Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs 
Is worth seeking 
It lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences 
So insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways 
Diverges from anything 
Andrei 
Their parents ' anguish 
The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
I 'm not even a fan of the genre 
Who understands how to create and sustain a mood 
Ararat feels like a book report 
Gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand 
Limited 
The film oozes craft . 
Notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness 
When the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
Of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past 
Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed 
Of ` eh 
Despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
Its crapulence 
Has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
Like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea 's recent past and south korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight . 
A random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
O fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing 
Fresh territory 
As predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and 
Strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain 
Michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here . 
A new scene 
Appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
Trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish 
'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept 
Engaging and 
Yarns ever 
Without being insightful 
The film 's thoroughly recycled plot 
Smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - broadway play . 
'll probably love it . 
Discloses almost nothing 
Weird and wonderful comedy

Accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits

The huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things

` punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . ' 
Strong themes 
Celluloid heaven 
Of all the halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
Disingenuous 
Boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years 
To admit i walked out of runteldat

Fool 
's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable 
So vivid 
Life and small delights 
You expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy 
Even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose 
You to give it a millisecond of thought 
Vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
Is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
I have a new favorite musical 
Flopping 
Minor classic 
You will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea .

The best animated 
That provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system 
A fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance 
Presents a frightening and compelling ` what if ? 
Another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled 
Have been much better 
Of his rental car 
Is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within 
Just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy 
The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
Crass , then gasp for gas , 
Taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving 
( allen 's ) best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
Cutting and blurry 
Begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully . 
Semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act 
Through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel 
Have to see this ! 
A director enjoying himself immensely 
Doubt the filmmakers ' motives 
Satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it 's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity 
Can not overcome blah characters 
Wrapped up in the characters 
The depths 
A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world 
Horrible '' and `` terrible 
Appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
Elevates the experience 
The intelligent , well-made b movie 
As well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted 
I thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love ` real ' . 
Deflated as he does 
Through all too painfully 
A meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
Most of the work 
As deflated as he does 
Soap opera that tornatore was right to cut 
This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
Effort to understand everyone 's point of view 
Shorter than britney 's cutoffs 
The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy 
Make the most of the large-screen format 
Of a film that are still looking for a common through-line 
Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies 
Smack of a hallmark hall of fame 
A movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions 
Unsympathetic 
She 's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
His most ardent fans 
Overeager

This listless feature 
No clear-cut hero 
To mind : so why is this so boring ? 
My two hours better watching 
Out there ! 
Wes craven 's presence is felt ; not the craven of ' a nightmare on elm street ' or ` the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` deadly friend . ' 
Bothered to construct a real story this time 
Oozing with attractive men 
Lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
The grieving process 
Appealing veneer 
A fairly inexperienced filmmaker

Delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers 
We 've seen ( eddie ) murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed 
Before landing squarely on `` stupid ''

Offensive and nothing at all like real life 
Debut effort by `` project greenlight '' winner 
Garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... 
The full monty , but 
Making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing 
Has none of the crackle of `` fatal attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 weeks '' , or even `` indecent proposal '' , 
Will once again be an honest and loving one 
Manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves 
Not good enough 
Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard 
Aggressively anti-erotic 
Does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas 
What a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride .

Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
Good and ambitious film 
A movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho 's fans . 
The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so 
A pleasing , often-funny comedy 
Wise and knowing 
Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j.k. rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
Distaste 
Spectacularly outrageous 
An inventive 
Gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust . 
The most horrific movie experience

Of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them 
Wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
A so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh 
While cherish does n't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller 
The visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 
Ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue

All its moodiness

Zero compelling storyline 
The color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure 
Is meaningful or memorable 
's so badly made on every level that i 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
Such a bore 
What makes this film special 
That reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism 
Is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement

Otherwise appalling 
A mediocre one 
In execution 
In its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .

Biting and witty feature 
A chuckle 
A vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness 
It ai n't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year 's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains . 
Olivier assayas ' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation 
On character 
Any way of gripping what its point is , 
Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
But very pleasing at its best moments 
Is small in scope , yet perfectly formed . 
Was vile enough .

Is turning in some delightful work on indie projects 
Disturbing 
Into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality 
Someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster 
Passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .

An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
Increasingly incoherent

Bears more than a whiff of exploitation , 
It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and 
Is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; 
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material 
At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
Reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' ( 1999 ) and ` analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year

Overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy

Captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago 
It 's going to be a trip 
Story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle 
Rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative 
While demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself 
That it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
An hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album

Nightmare 
If you 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need . 
Lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works 
Reality tv obsession 
Surprisingly inoffensive 
The women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes 
Her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant 
Strong themes of familial ties 
Is intriguing , provocative stuff . 
Great party 
It 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` tonight . '' 
Seems to play on a 10-year delay 
Made mamet 's `` house of games '' and last fall 's `` heist '' so much fun 
( seagal 's ) strenuous attempt 
The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed 
Every indulgent , indie trick in the book 
Maybe leblanc thought , `` hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . '' 
'll be rewarded with some fine acting . 
Shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
So bad in a major movie 
This is pure , exciting moviemaking . 
Suitable summer entertainment 
In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
Its exquisite acting 
, evans is no hollywood villain 
For too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots 
Central flaw 
Of its pretensions 
It was written for no one 
Of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother 
, nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
A no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad 
From too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman 
's his strongest performance since the doors 
Horrible 
Gradually accumulates more layers 
Bad prose 
Lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they 'll get plenty ) 
So much crypt mist in the brain 
As if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese 
Hard to conceive anyone else in their roles 
A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
Is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake 
Drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power . 
Just plain crap 
This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , 
Plodding action sequences 
While he talks 
Visually ravishing 
Phenomenal performances 
Familiar and predictable , and 
Desperation 
Only seems to care about the bottom line 
Will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart . 
Callow pretension 
Is greatness here 
Comfortable niche 
It 's never as solid as you want it to be 
I 'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
Like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
Works on any number of levels 
Mystery devoid 
, enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment . 
Surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... 
A complete waste 
The unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
The corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
Moving documentary 
Slam-bang

Too many wrong turns 
Do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
Bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate 
Transfixes the audience . 
The similarly ill-timed antitrust 
With intelligence and care 
Clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set 
Most pleasurable movies 
From the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap 
's a dull girl , that 's all . 
A reworking of die hard and cliffhanger 
One who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep 
The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati 
Never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
The adjective ` gentle ' applies 
Bogs down in a surfeit of characters 
Is a success . 
Confusing and horrifying vision 
Is disposable 
Are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care . 
But certainly not without merit 
Showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase 
Its excellent use 
's fun for kids of any age . 
Is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients 
It is n't very good 
Calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored 
The sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
So overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a bu?uel retrospective 
It squanders chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
Is surprisingly brilliant 
Wickedly funny , visually engrossing , 
Is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years 
's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . 
Are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times 
Is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was 
Period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans 
Makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing . 
I 'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal 
The screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen .

Cheery and tranquil 
The simpering soundtrack 
Absorbing character study by andr�� turpin . 
That strikes a very resonant chord 
Be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor 
Seem tired and , what 's worse , routine 
Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
A new kind of high 
Colorful , joyous celebration 
Even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament 
Labors as storytelling 
Succeeds as a well-made evocation 
Embellished by editing 
A waterlogged version of ` fatal attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads 
Son of the bride , proves it 's never too late to learn . 
From pinnacle to pinnacle 
Funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad 
Say it was a guilty pleasure

She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 
The road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination 
I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
Achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
Escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions .

Yet another tired old vision 
Offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . 
Do n't know whether to admire the film 's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace 
What great cinema can really do 
Is more timely now than ever . 
One adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen 
Too bland to be interesting 
Through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
This nervy oddity , like modern art should . 
Alternately touching and funny 
Pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
Banal and

Writer-director danny verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
Best way 
The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention . 
Created a beautiful canvas 
A surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . 
Charm or texture 
It 's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
Blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop 
Effecting 
Plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family 
False and 
The trifecta of badness 
Animated movies in quite a while 
Of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh 
The only entertainment 
Darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
Two-dimensional and 
Needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
Cremaster 3 '' should come with the warning `` for serious film buffs only ! '' 
Youthful affluence 
If only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition 
Dumb and derivative horror

, metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
You emerge dazed , confused as to whether you 've seen pornography or documentary . 
So rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
Becomes instead a grating endurance test 
A middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising 
's a masterpeice . 
Thoughtful and rewarding 
Of the cinema world 's great visual stylists 
Inimitable scenes 
A skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation ... just about as chilling and unsettling as ` manhunter '

Bubbles up out of john c. walsh 's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie 
The most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since `` saving private ryan '' 
What makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
Marvelous verdu 
This movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
Because it is japanese and yet feels universal 
More bizarre than actually amusing

As is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr. murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
Lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat 
The quiet american is n't a bad film , it 's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
Irresistibly 
Seen ( eddie ) 
Throughout this funny film 
While the production details are lavish 
Made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid 
A funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy 
That it makes edward burns ' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde 
Is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
Unforced comedy-drama 
Interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
Group articulates a flood of emotion . 
No way 
American and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , 
Feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
It 's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas . 
This tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before . 
Bad direction and bad acting -- 
A big-budget/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event . 
Good-naturedness 
Is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen 
Under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films 
Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often 
Somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
Blind date , only less 
Are totally estranged from reality 
The actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script 's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
Is a lumbering , wheezy drag ... 
Less enjoyable 
In the middle of hopeful 
Amused by the idea 
Genuinely moving 
Scenes all end in someone screaming 
A huge disappointment coming , as it does , 
Flat champagne 
A terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one 
Leads to a satisfying destination 
With dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
The disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
Thematically complex 
If there 's a heaven for bad movies 
Sustains a higher plateau 
Has merit 
The feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania 
's simply unbearable 
It 's lousy 
Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp 
Slapdash disaster 
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
Inspiring tale 
's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
, considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
Such high-profile talent serve such literate material 
He has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . 
It has fun with the quirks of family life , 
Ponderous and charmless 
If the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm 
It does n't make any sense 
I 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
After collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich�� has been unturned . 
Take you down a familiar road with a few twists 
's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
... the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . 
Been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture 
Prefabricated 
Tired old 
The gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack 
It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars 
All in all , brown sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted . 
An underachiever 
The filmmakers were worried 
Of good stuff 
A smart , steamy mix 
Must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . 
Shining performance 
Captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
Crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection 
Those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us 
Like a precious and finely cut diamond 
Trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years 
Is of brian de palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career 
Time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
Somewhere lies ... footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
Do n't need to try very hard 
The fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
, this halloween is a gory slash-fest . 
That was written down 
Is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still . 
Uninvolving 
When ( reno ) lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w. bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . 
' rip-off 
'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't 
They have a tendency to slip into hokum 
A good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days 
In addition to scoring high for originality of plot 
Have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams 
Is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out 
Bad film you thought was going to be really awful 
Is a film for the under-7 crowd 
Of this so-called satire 
( seagal 's ) 
Come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free 
Enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining 
Feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off 
Love in remembrance 
For a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus 
The film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
Glorified 
The kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of 
Is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy . 
An epic rather than 
Two unrelated shorts that falls far short 
As compelling or as believable 
's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . 
Fell apart 
The concept is a hoot . 
Nair 's cast is so large it 's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion 
's lovely and amazing 
Admission for the ridicule factor 
Hour-and-a-half-long commercial 
An alfred hitchcock movie 
May prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences 
Some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy 
Visually graceful 
Worse than bland 
's not scary , not smart and not engaging 
Splendid actors 
Its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis 
The film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
Enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
Delving 
Give exposure to some talented performers 
're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination 
The structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings 
Things insipid 
Lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable 
Hugely overwritten 
A nightmare 
Suspenseful enough for older kids but not 
A lyrical and celebratory vision 
The end it 's as sweet as greenfingers 
Tasteful little revision works 
A reprieve 
Filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two 
Strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
Terminally brain dead production 
Holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin 's film serves up with style and empathy . 
Too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize 
Lacks 
Whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is 
, even-flowing tone 
Absurdities 
A fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism 
Skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults 
Impressed 
Directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
Is the rare common-man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness 
Beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
I had a lot of problems with this movie . 
Ingenious 
Is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . 
A sexy , surprising romance 
I can imagine this movie as a b & w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
Seems a prostituted muse ... 
Sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
Does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
Could make you weep 
Goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle 
Predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
The movie 's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
Define a generation 
Is still worth 
, painful 
, fireballs and revenge 
A typical bible killer story 
A flawed but engrossing thriller . 
Endearing cast 
Drowns in sap . 
That it 's offensive , 
'd be lying if i said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of kung pow . 
( at least ) moore is a real charmer . 
The laborious pacing 
A pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative 
Especially clever 
Has wonderfully funny moments 
Would have saved this film a world of hurt 
Infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm 
Incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one 
I 'll go out on a limb . 
As beautifully shaped and 
As morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder 
Overlong and not well-acted , but 
Howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a bu?uel retrospective . 
Their own rhythm 
An incomprehensible 
Vicious and 
... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
Will want to see over and over again 
Sophisticated , discerning taste 
Will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face . 
Long and eventful spiritual journey 
Nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
-- and timely 
Could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population 
Love moore or 
Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and 
A few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television 
The comedy is nonexistent . 
In three gags in white 's intermittently wise script 
About ten 
With amazing finesse 
Movie-biz 
Seen such self-amused trash 
Veers 
Team 
Of self-congratulation between actor and director 
Come off too amateurish and awkward 
Prolific director 
Many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
Unbelievable na?vet�� and arbitrary flashbacks 
Like all of egoyan 's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
Works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing 
A waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors 
Well-meant but unoriginal 
Ghandi 
, kinky fun 
Refreshed and 
Tom green stages his gags as assaults on america 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony 
Discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again 
May be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black 
Overwrought ending 
Otto-sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye . 
Form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare 
Drown out 
The phenomenal , water-born cinematography 
Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
Production values & christian bale 's charisma make up for a derivative plot 
This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton 's ever-watchful gaze 
Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid . 
Played and smartly directed . 
Has no reason to exist 
Has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar 
Few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , 
A beautiful , aching sadness 
Throwaway 
Of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story 
Been all but decommissioned 
's badder than bad . 
A smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy 
Does so without compromising that complexity 
Explosive physical energy and 
Only belly laughs 
Nice , harmless 
Except : film overboard 
Been cobbled together onscreen 
Laborious 
Damned funny 
Bad luck and 
Has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery 
A mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director 's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
Who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
The down-to-earth bullock 
Of hell so shattering it 
A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs 
's just grating 
Of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay 
Pleasing at its best moments 
Is often very funny 
Off more than he or anyone else could chew 
An ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be 
're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity 
Like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours 
The most oddly honest hollywood document of all 
With the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel 
Definitely funny stuff 
The only thing scary about feardotcom 
Kafka 
It 's a very sincere work 
Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me 
No timeout 
A colorful , joyous celebration of life ; 
That come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note 
Provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history 
The film is a very good viewing alternative for young women . 
Teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes 
Could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals 
Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm 
That delivers a surprising 
You 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
Lyrical and celebratory 
Career-best performances 
For technical flaws to get in the way 
Sixties ' rockumentary milestones 
The film , while it 's not completely wreaked 
Endearing about it . 
Whenever you think you 've figured out late marriage 
Sustain the buoyant energy level of the film 's city beginnings into its country conclusion ' 
Bargain-basement 
Via kirsten dunst 's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy 
Lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
Director michael cacoyannis 
Is breathtaking 
Is a particularly vexing handicap 
Yet , it must be admitted , 
Script is n't up to the level of the direction 
Fairly solid 
Roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude . 
Screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
An otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending 
When he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling 
Definitely tasty and sweet 
Balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams 
Strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder 
That will leave you wondering about the characters ' lives after the clever credits roll 
Kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . 
Glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . 
Layered and stylistic 
A uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession 
Anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . 
Menace 
Ambiguous and nothing 
One-dimensional 
Gross 
's all the stronger because of it 
No new plot conceptions or environmental changes 
Of death in this bitter italian comedy 
This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
Art-house to the core 
She sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
, it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair 
Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being . 
Becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion 
, it may just scare the pants off you . 
Mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete 
A loud , witless mess 
, ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast . 
And yet , it still works . 
Form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand 
An act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion 
The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way 
Of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
Fine-looking film 
Sucker 
Who could too easily become comic relief in any other film 
Mindless action flick 
With too much exploitation and too little art 
Content merely 
Of malaise 
Hot 
If we 're seeing something purer than the real thing 
Portrayals 
A bold biographical fantasia 
Using an endearing cast 
Its make-believe promise of life 
Sweet treasure and something 
Great companion piece 
Holds itself 
The theater in the first 10 minutes 
A diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience 
Devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
Like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's . 
Slick 
, madonna 's cameo does n't suck ! 
I could n't recommend this film more . 
These are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
Scratching your head in amazement over the fact 
's not original enough . 
Though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there 's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
While easier to sit through than most of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
Fans of plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film 
Often hilarious . 
Miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
Much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep . 
Recognize any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end 
Come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook 
Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
Right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong 
With increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
Agonizing , catch-22 
The movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
To make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
To be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other 
All the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital 
Inept direction , 
Beauty reeks 
Sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions 
Foul up 
Cinematic appeal 
The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
A seriously bad film 
At the right film 
Stereotypical 
Written 
Woefully hackneyed movie 
, it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
Low-budget hybrid 
Reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , 
But also nicely done 
Acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts 
Is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems 
Succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad 
-- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same 
's mildly entertaining 
, manipulative 
There 's a plethora of characters in this picture , 
A menace 
A squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula 
, ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
By the most random of chances 
Bright , inventive 
Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , 
That the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over 
Benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
Outweigh the positives 
Make a classic theater piece 
A rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale 
A ploddingly melodramatic structure 
Satisfying summer blockbuster 
The barriers finally prove to be too great 
Gay and lesbian children 
A rather listless amble 
That you wo n't care 
Will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long 
Obnoxious as tom green 's freddie got fingered 
Represents adam sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe 
The film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
Heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this 
Nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants 
Of being able to give full performances 
Denuded 
Existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god 
A fresh idea 
`` home movie '' is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen 
Film aficionados can not help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director 's cut . ' 
Means to face your fears 
I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone 
Sophomore effort 
, stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . 
It one of the year 's most enjoyable releases 
Bland , obnoxious 88-minute 
Are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny 
Shapes history 
Pretty watchable 
A japan bustling 
One of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness 
Fiercely clever and subtle 
Is an object lesson in period filmmaking 
The worst titles in recent cinematic history 
Great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood 
In the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . 
Reprehensible 
That hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy 
Some interesting storytelling devices 
Engaging fantasy 
As bad as you think 
Is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
Is trite 
Has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you 
An acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare 
If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong 
Be , by its art and heart , a necessary one 
Self-deprecating , biting and witty feature 
Layer upon layer of action man clich�� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( woo 's ) best work 
Power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror 
Routine stuff yuen 
Vile , incoherent mess 
While cleverly worked out 
Is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
Plot lapses 
Smartly and 
Like a true star 
Of intelligence or invention 
So with an artistry that also smacks of revelation 
The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing 
Upscale 
Material realm 
Of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim 
, the project should have been made for the tube . 
, featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
Signature style 
Zings all the way 
Pan nalin 's exposition is beautiful and mysterious 
Smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling 
( t ) he script is n't up to the level of the direction 
Hugely entertaining and 
To the integrity and vision of the band 
A little more special 
Nothing good can happen 
Cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . 
Is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
Uninspired preachy and clich��d 
Wears 
Deeply unpleasant 
The only thing avary seems to care about 
A fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action 
I think even fans of sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting 
Maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips 
Everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial 
The film 's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
Nonsensical 
Sustain laughs 
Mannerisms and self-indulgence 
Is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend 
Made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention 
, bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action 
Has a fluid , no-nonsense authority 
You go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller 
Girl-meets-girl romantic comedy 
The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based . 
Witty and sophisticated

It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
Itself is about something very interesting and odd that 
Guest appearance 
It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame . 
An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
Hart 's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character . 
Me 
Is thought-provoking . 
Its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting 
Has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
Sports 
We 're drawn in by the dark luster . 
Terribly episodic and 
Gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
The empty stud knockabout of equilibrium 
More time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
During which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
It wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate 
This story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...

Some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither

A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro .

One of the best gay love stories ever made 
Crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
With we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in .

Scattered 
Find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests 
Swooning elegance 
Deep as a petri dish 
, it 's nowhere near as good as the original . 
Viscerally exciting 
's nowhere near 
Leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending 
A stirring , funny and 
It 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair 
This indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
Well , jason 's gone to manhattan and hell 
Still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch 
Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by india 's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
A tremendous piece of work 
Absorbing 
Relentlessly saccharine 
A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more 
Really gives the film its oomph 
The screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain 
A waterlogged version of ` fatal attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
Cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance 
Silly summer entertainment 
Those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .

One terrific score and 
Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest 
Pinochet 
Shreve 's graceful dual narrative 
Hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb

Is high on squaddie banter 
For good 
Is highly pleasurable . 
Life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , 
One in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable 
The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice . 
Was n't a good movie

Is a masterfully conducted work 
That constantly defies expectation 
You 'll find in this dreary mess . 
The unmistakable stamp of authority

His charming 2000 debut shanghai noon 
It pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators

From burkina faso 
Joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , 
Unabashedly romantic picture 
It 's a funny no-brainer 
One of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then . 
A dark-as-pitch comedy 
Has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
Is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious 
This region and 
For quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
Drivel

Needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds 
With all its flaws 
It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer . 
A terrific screenplay and fanciful direction

Got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane

Intelligent , realistic portrayal 
Funnier than being about something

As little cleavage 
Prolonged and boring 
Confrontations 
Fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation 
The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and 
A rather unique approach to documentary 
Like most of jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand 
This fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped

( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
With a sensitivity 
For almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese 's 168-minute gangs of new york 
Capture the minds and hearts of many 
Offensive and redundant 
Caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare 
Memorable directorial debut 
Do n't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
Comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
Soulless

Skip this turd 
Thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity 
Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , 
Pretentious . 
Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
To attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
High drama 
Appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy 
An ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness 
Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic 
Tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run 
Horribly depressing and not 
A moving and weighty depiction of one family 's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
This quality band may pick up new admirers 
Demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested 
This humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore . ' 
A superior moral tone

The cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script 
Filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that does n't always jell with sean penn 's monotone narration

To rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours 
A new treasure of the hermitage 
Is drowned out by director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap 
Their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script 
The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache .

A weird little movie that 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l.a. 's show-biz and media subcultures .

Like john le carr�� with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
For all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop freudianism .

An extraordinary poignancy , and the story 
Paper-thin supporting characters 
Of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film 
There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking 
Very tasteful rock 
Murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc 's ,

Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and 
Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion

Of complacency 
That rare movie 
Such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy

At soccer hooliganism 
Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags 
The most important and exhilarating forms 
Fred schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . 
A disaster 
Not a participant 
It 's really unclear why this project was undertaken 
Sags in pace 
Inadequately motivated 
Able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting 
It 's the image that really tells the tale . 
Captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe

Silly horror movies 
In exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity 
Vivid characters and 
, blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
Something for everyone . 
Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
A truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation . 
With a moral 
Achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation 
Chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in 
Few early laughs 
... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired . 
Transcends 
Straight-to-video 
Could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up 
Great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood . 
The original new testament stories so compelling 
Here is unusually tame 
A.e.w. mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks `` the four feathers '' bare 
Safe 
For mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon 
It 's a loathsome movie , it really is 
There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but peter mattei 's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note . 
Lazy , miserable and smug 
, for the most part , credible 
Their parents 
The best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made 
Byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . 
Starts off witty and sophisticated 
Makes this movie worth seeing 
Of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances 
Most creative mayhem 
With its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer 
Fun factor 
Original fantasy film 
Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
Its characters tissue-thin 
Time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
There is n't one true ` chan moment ' . 
Canada 's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
This new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
Cinematic experience 
Reach much further than we imagine 
Make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see 
Run-of-the-filth 
Incoherence 
A no-holds-barred cinematic treat . 
Addict 
It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
Second helpings 
Wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching 
Awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story 
Up out of john c. walsh 's pipe dream 
As generic as its title 
The most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season 
That it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls 
Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . 
Is an ` action film ' mired in stasis 
Of its sense of fun or energy 
To make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson 
Breathtakingly assured and stylish work 
Hogwash 
Let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , 
To drag on for nearly three hours 
Tired , talky feel 
Praise 
Ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
The movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts 
Exquisite 
Exasperatingly 
For most of the characters 
Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . 
Big ending surprise 
If it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or 
Amazingly evocative film from three decades ago 
Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers 
That the film is never dull 
A lackluster script 
Stooping to base melodrama 
It 's a thin notion 
Sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama 
He thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
A niche hit 
Comes across as both shallow and dim-witted 
Cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , 
The brawn , but not 
Mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
Make for a winning , heartwarming yarn 
Upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product 
Counter the crudity 
Accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people 
Chilling , unnerving film 
Has become the master of innuendo . 
Unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle 
's soulful and unslick 
Still serious problem 
A winning comedy 
Suicide 
The major problem 
That reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm 
The psychology 101 study of romantic obsession 
Of passion , grief and fear 
The hours represents two of those well spent 
Trouble 
The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
That 's something i would rather live in denial about 
The torments and angst 
Yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination 
To doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything 
Of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves 
The shocking conclusion 
Deals with first love sweetly 
It does n't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain . 
Creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that 's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance 
In all fairness 
Laid-back 
's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself 
And pat storytelling 
A forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself 
Made the original men in black such a pleasure 
While the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own . 
Stirring , 
Appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , 
Fiend 
Pure craft 
Pok��mon 4ever is terrifying 
Might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
That ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film 
A grim future 
The story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and 
Skip the film 
For a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture 
To sit through it again 
Also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end 
A flawed human 
A good match 
A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and 
Attractive about this movie 
Were more repulsive 
Too long , and larded with exposition 
Found the movie as divided against itself 
Goodness 
, in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
Taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions 
Part of the charm of satin rouge 
The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent 
That brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors 
're on the edge of your seat 
From the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
The works of an artist 
Edge to it 
Significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old 
Its director could ever have dreamed 
An awkwardly contrived exercise 
To easy feel-good sentiments 
, collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure 
If we 're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she 's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ? 
Is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be 
Wise and deadpan humorous . 
've a taste for the quirky 
Of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least 
Is completely lacking in charm and charisma 
Takes big bloody chomps out of it 
Imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread 
It 's provocative stuff , 
To accomplish what few sequels can 
A memorable directorial debut 
Aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script 
An inconclusive ending 
Passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
With a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments 
A gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
A great script brought down by lousy direction . 
Content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool 
'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
Zinger-filled 
Clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and 
, you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
Bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
Murder and mayhem 
Nearly incoherent 
Is n't particularly assaultive 
That takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth 
To a sunshine state 
Introspective and 
For the tube 
Shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie . 
Of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny 
The rest is just an overexposed waste of film 
Emotionally strong and 
Wholly unnecessary 
Keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong 
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , 
Beloved 
Transcendent performance 
An oscar 
A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
On a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers 
, in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
Is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it 's based upon 
That encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow 
More ridiculous 
The magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , 
Dramatic arc 
An extraordinary poignancy , 
Absurdities and 
Multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation 
Unoriginal 
That run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
Feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
Takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors 
Take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis 
A story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true 
Whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau 
A college keg party 
, low-budget and tired 
Mira sorvino 's limitations 
Is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks 
Hostile 
A copout 
While clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying 
Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` ah , yes , here 
Its apparent glee 
Profanities 
Is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers 
Surprisingly decent 
Am baffled by jason x. 
It offers hope 
An experience that is richer than anticipated 
You can fire a torpedo through some of clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any oscars 
Have given this movie a rating of zero . 
Style and humor 
Most magical and most 
As deep as a petri dish 
Of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone 
Something for everyone 
It looks neat 
Fights 
Is meaningless , vapid and devoid 
It 's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him 
Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash 
What allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors 
The scarifying 
It 's the best sequel since the empire strikes back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
Strongly 
First mistake 
Needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese 
'' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
This broken character study 
Sensitive , cultivated treatment 
Torture and 
Seagal 
Little more than routine 
Both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one 
Shockers since the evil dead 
Spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest the mummy returns 
The movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clich��d and too often strains credulity 
's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
Of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them 
Does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
Has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure 
... an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle . 
, an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r��sum�� loaded with credits like `` girl in bar # 3 . '' 
To filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
The movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy 
To be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama 
Comes along every day 
Always entertaining , 
A good natured warning 
Succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing 
A fascinating part of theater history 
Understandable 
Feel-good movie 
A woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title 
A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic 
A much better documentary 
's pretty stupid 
Acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni 
If the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
Prevent its tragic waste of life 
The performances are uniformly good . 
The phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings 
The film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
Blood work is for you . 
Into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters 
Confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema . 
At times uncommonly moving 
Helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats 
The color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative 
Art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema . 
Moved by this drama 
Survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine 
Richly detailed 
'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense . 
Simple title 
Sewer rats 
The nonstop artifice 
I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it 
By characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
An original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie 
In the pile of useless actioners 
Coupled with pitch-perfect acting 
Is a dud 
More chaotic than entertaining 
In its courageousness , and comedic employment 
Guessing at almost every turn 
Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen 
Offensive and 
That never quite gel 
Deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered 
If the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us

Flawless film , 
Of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival

Super-stupid 
An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
Is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair 
Though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 
My big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it 's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
Blacked out 
E.t. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
There 's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
This romantic comedy 
Includes the line ` my stepdad 's not mean , he 's just adjusting ' 
With the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic 
For an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge 
It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
Light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't fret about the calories because there 's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it 's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .

Gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years . 
Its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .

Offbeat thriller 
Warm 
Into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes 
Showcases the city 's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything 
Is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... 
The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
Missed opportunities . 
See an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles 
Rewards 
To wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
Low-budget constraints 
Are fantastic . 
The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable 
Emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine 
This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
Utterly pointless 
Far too sentimental 
At 90 minutes this movie is short 
Phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene 's prose , and 
Is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it 's a love story as sanguine as its title . 
Is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience 's meat grinder one more time 
Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 
What gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman 's script 
Elevate 
Ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving 
Is as delightful 
Cheap-shot mediocrity 
The balance between the fantastic and the believable 
There 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all 
Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
An even less capable trio 
Affirm

Rare window 
Warm and exotic . 
Mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
Brings the proper conviction 
Goes downhill . 
The fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , 
Nothing i had n't already seen . 
But fun . 
Better films

This film 's impressive performances and adept direction 
An attention to detail 
Considerable skill and determination , 
Mainstream hollywood 
Masterpiece . 
I 'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
A tv episode rather than a documentary 
Do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
Is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
Grumble 
, it 's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror . 
To consider the looseness of the piece 
No entertainment value 
Would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel 
Are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before 
Comes together as a coherent whole 
Great shame 
Thought it was going to be 
Depressing , ruthlessly pained

The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
A sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time 
Adam watstein with finishing it at all 
Naturally dramatic 
Is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
The performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .

Yes , ` it 's like having an old friend for dinner ' .

Tortured and 
A con artist and 
A grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendor that can be seen in other films 
Wild , endearing , masterful 
Realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion 
This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` why ? 
Nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 
How far herzog has fallen 
Are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude

're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you 
It 's just too dry and too placid

Steven shainberg 's adaptation of mary gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
Sly female empowerment movie 
Crummy . 
The film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters 
It has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh 
At once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious . 
It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat .

Uninspired .

Wastes its time on mood rather than 
A love song to the movies 
As you might to resist , if you 've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson 
It is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose 
Life-embracing 
Hastily and amateurishly 
By the full monty 
Her most charmless 
For the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats 
Profane and exploitative 
Seemed bored 
Ca n't help but feel ` stoked 
Has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 
A piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety 
A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie . 
The occasional bursts of sharp writing 
Bottomlessly cynical 
Can sound so dull 
Of quiet desperation 
Intolerable levels 
Feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids 
Have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood 
Wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture 
Truly gorgeous 
Entirely witless and inane 
Dying and 
Intacto 's luckiest stroke 
Barely defensible sexual violence 
The graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
Cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end 
Succumbing to its own bathos 
Funny and human and really 
Critically insightful 
Vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
In a fresh way 
A successful adaptation and 
Good performances 
Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe 
Us to remember that life 's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced 
Genuinely funny ensemble 
An enjoyable film 
Is funny , charming and quirky 
Intelligent , and

Australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place . 
Work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house 
A sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud 
Truly magical 
The sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then 
Straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company . 
, mean-spirited lashing 
I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors 
The pratfalls but little else 
Could fail to crack a smile at 
Biggest 
Energetic , violent movie 
, the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing . 
Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women . 
That lacks juice and delight 
Funny without hitting below the belt 
Pristine camerawork 
You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
Top-notch cast 
It 's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
About growing up that we do n't see often enough these days 
Wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
Fruitful 
The acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here 
An original and highly cerebral examination 
An emotional edge 
Inventive directors 
Directed with verve 
Babak payami 's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
Is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
Is that its own action is n't very effective . 
My sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . 
Oddly 
Looks elsewhere 
Waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway 
Perfectly executed and 
This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama 
A rejected x-files episode 
Keenest pleasures 
The power of poetry and passion 
Horrors ! ) 
A great time 
Compulsively watchable 
Was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
An attraction that crosses sexual identity 
Lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
The structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings .

Find a ` literary ' filmmaking style 
Aliens and 
Offensive , puerile and 
Empty , fetishistic violence 
This strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
Wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars 
The boat loads of people who try to escape the country 
Some of the unsung heroes of 20th century 
Nearly as dreadful as expected 
Its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering

Sappy script 
Uni-dimensional nonsense machine 
Would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .

Its spirit of iconoclastic abandon 
The thousands of americans who die hideously 
A strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude 
The delicious pulpiness 
The preaching message 
Is n't the most edgy piece of disney animation 
Makes sense , with its unbelievable na?vet�� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
Provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
Dubious 
Its utter sincerity 
... continue to impress 
Davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy . 
Is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
Sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer 
A too-conscientious adaptation 
For historical truth and realism 
A lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential 
It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` look at this ! 
Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny 
One of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
A loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny 
Sitting through dahmer 's two hours 
A gleefully grungy 
Noble end 
These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i 'm all for that 
We call the ` wow ' factor 
Eating , sleeping and stress-reducing 
The paper-thin characterizations and 
Lively songs 
Stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and 
Wasted in it 
A gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but 
Hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare 
Shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives 
Show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting 
To the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys 
's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
Inside unnecessary films 
Problematic script 
Pretty good overall picture 
For one of the worst movies of one year 
That trademark grin of his -- 
Far less endearing 
, incomprehensible , vicious and absurd 
An enjoyably 
Revenge , and romance 
Derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining 
The most awful acts are committed 
Elusive , yet inexplicably 
Inexpressive 
Being snared in its own tangled plot 
Impenetrable and 
Who die hideously 
Plays like a reading from bartlett 's familiar quotations 
Like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it 's never too late to learn . 
What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
Transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film 
A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , 
Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them 
Just more of the same , 
The acting is amateurish 
Profound 
Something really good 
Into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear 
Sing beautifully and act adequately 
Metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story 
I ca n't recommend it . 
Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
Is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable 
An aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
Credible 
Good , organic character work 
Director paul cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach 
A dreary tract 
A balanced film 
Mixed messages , 
Falls into the trap of pretention 
Suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman 
's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated 
Neighborhood 
, the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . 
Guide a loose , poorly structured film 
The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances . 
Wewannour money back , actually 
The result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally could n't care less . 
Grant 's two best films

One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes 
Of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year 
Through its hackneyed elements 
Sketchy but nevertheless

Offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject 
Benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth 
Labors as storytelling . 
Understands how to create and sustain a mood 
An enthralling , 
Hailed 
A gorgeous pair 
Far-flung , illogical 
From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast 
Flavorless 
The addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
Particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , 
At once laughable 
A successful career in tv 
Evolved from star to superstar 
Is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
Animated drivel 
The rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
No wit , 
, much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
Like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break 
A b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget .

Applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line

Instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair 
Of beautiful movement and inside information 
While not quite `` shrek '' or `` monsters , inc. '' , it 's not too bad . 
The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . 
Stupid 
It 's an entertaining movie , 
... the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ... 
Silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another 
The old boy 's characters more quick-witted than any english lit 
Tight and nasty 
Modernizes a.e.w. mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks `` the four feathers '' bare . 
John hughes comedy 
That you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out 
Is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 
Literary desecrations 
Horribly depressing and not very well done 
Ever-growing category 
Emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook 
Got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem 
Maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
, groan and hiss 
Tries to be smart 
Uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea 
Like a fish that 's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
Too clich��d 
Generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal 
Does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
What a film can be 
Sweet-tempered comedy 
Relegated to the background -- a welcome step 
It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time 
After next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
The film 's highlight 
Outside the under-10 set 
Is deeply concerned with morality 
His penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses 
Naipaul original 
Full of itself

Of a good time for both children and parents 
Avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and

Sooooo tired 
The thrill of the chill 
An oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture 
Imagine having more fun watching a documentary 
A compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart 
Blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .

To kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies 
The scorpion king more than ably meets those standards 
Woven together skilfully 
The big-screen scooby 
Is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt 
There 's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action . 
's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain 
The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
Unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny 
Descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured 
Captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse

It goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults 
An enthralling , entertaining feature . 
Drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
Sour attempt 
The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm .

Of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics 
Boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , 
Believability was n't one of the film 's virtues .

Is a distinct rarity , and an event . 
Sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell

Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .

Too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen 
The horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest 
Stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness 
Smarter 
Bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
Becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , 
Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
Wonderful , ghastly 
Given it a one-star rating 
Ruthlessly pained 
Never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs 
Is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie 
Worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham 
Expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street . 
Will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
Pull it back 
A bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
Almost every single facet of production 
The acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans . 
Psychologically savvy 
, some of it is honestly affecting 
Victim to sloppy plotting 
A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire . 
Unexpected twists 
Neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition 
Strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve 
So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
Drowning 's too good for this sucker .

Forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves 
A terrific date movie

Seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good 
Is definitely worth seeing 
An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
Is one baaaaaaaaad movie 
Naked teenagers horror flick 
Texture and realism 
The story really has no place to go since simone is not real 
Ca n't quite live up to it 
Finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice 
While the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
Acting horribly 
All-night 
Will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
Is just such an achievement 
Almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like `` the addams family '' to everyone looking in ... `` my big fat greek wedding '' comes from the heart ... 
's truly deserving of its oscar nomination 
Most depressing 
Could have turned this into an argentine retread of `` iris '' or `` american beauty , '' but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films . 
A fish that 's lived too long 
The small , human moments 
Of the tooth and claw of human power 
A gentle waking coma 
Although i did n't hate this one , it 's not very good either . 
Paved with good intentions leads to the video store '' 
One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms. spears . 
The same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection 
Is a real charmer . 
The word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer 's tribute to a courageous scottish lady 
Like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
Opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it 
The bottom tier

With acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut

Yes , i suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i did n't .

Got a house full of tots -- do n't worry 
Try as you might to resist , if you 've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
Also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular 
Since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer 
It 's tough to watch , 
Huge mess 
Very well-written and very well-acted 
Has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works 
Predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
Zings all the way through with originality , humor and pathos 
Engages 
's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad 
Pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia 
Make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season .

Would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
Enhances the personal touch of manual animation 
Give it a marginal thumbs up 
The film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority .

Featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
Foolish choices for advice 
Old-hat province 
Bottom-of-the-bill 
Its questionable satirical ambivalence 
The plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
Niches 
Are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation 
Be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals 
Enjoyable 
Powerful , naturally dramatic piece

A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
Often surprising twists and an intermingling of naivet�� and sophistication

The salton sea has moments of inspired humor , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
Eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
Has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection 
Offer some modest amusements 
Bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst 's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy

Lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) 
Does her best 
Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
A lot of stamina and vitality 
It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but 
As the scruffy sands of its titular community 
Seeing himself in the other , 
Evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits 
Premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper 
Does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously 
Its ability to shock and amaze 
Make j.k. rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore 
Quite a comedy nor 
Of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name 
A moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places 
Cleverly constructed scenario 
Consumed by lust and love 
Has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
Unoriginal run 
, it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
Fascinating documentary 
Gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels 
, often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy 
Is a good one 
It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers 
An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation 
A film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
A vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , color and cringe . 
Is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
Was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal 
Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
Of the best looking and stylish 
Little fuss or noise 
Like a change in ( herzog 's ) personal policy than a half-hearted fluke . 
A movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough 
Visual hideousness 
A decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition 
Who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
The film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
Leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated 
Of you-are-there immediacy 
Sterling ensemble cast 
A charming , banter-filled comedy ... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie 's success . 
Up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah

Show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

Holocaust escape story 
Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory . 
A good yarn 
More of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
, the effect comes off as self-parody . 
It counts heart as important as humor 
A touching drama about old age and grief 
Lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context 
Too loud , too goofy and too short 
It 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
Work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon 
The precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway 
A rather toothless take 
It challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should . 
Addition to hoffman 's powerful acting clinic 
Does a disservice to the audience and to the genre 
There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening . 
Treats us to an aimless hodgepodge 
Of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film 
Picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film 
A film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
Is surprisingly refreshing 
Is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story 
Can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin ' down 
Laughs at how clever it 's being .

A memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues 
Could have been crisper and punchier , 
Sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time 
The cinematic equivalent of high humidity 
Completely honest , open-hearted film 
Take notice 
( clooney 's ) debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . 
Plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up 
( t ) he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .

Overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption 
Fresh , entertaining comedy 
With all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
Never change . 
With an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships 
Will have a great time 
, slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
Intelligent 
's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family 
Candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand 
The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... 
Back-stabbing , inter-racial desire 
Are nowhere near 
Ended up in a movie this bad 
Somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
A weirdly beautiful place 
Offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
The movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
I liked about schmidt a lot , 
Does n't work as either . 
Low-budget affair 
That comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer 's tribute to a courageous scottish lady 
Unaware 
Contrived situations 
Have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
Spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
Surehanded direction 
Very slow , uneventful 
In short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is 
Trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
Style and mystification 
Skunk 
Brosnan 's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
Forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore . 
Sophisticated and 
An entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller . 
In a more ambitious movie 
Cliched dialogue 
The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is 
Is n't nearly as funny 
Humorous and 
Her considerable talents 
Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
Purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . 
Is barely an hour long . 
Riveted 
Muck 
A far bigger , far more meaningful story 
A complex psychological drama 
The transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and 
All excited about a chocolate eclair

Dumb , narratively chaotic 
A sense of real magic , perhaps . 
Breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry

Described as a ghost story gone badly awry 
Insightfully written , delicately performed

A wild , endearing , masterful documentary 
A dreadful day in irish history 
Conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny 
It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual 
Worked better as a one-hour tv documentary 
Is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience 
That plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast 
The ideas tie together beautifully 
Quite a nosedive 
The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but 
A splendid meal 
Has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen 
Is a gem 
Bad in a major movie 
Come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music

I 'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but 
You 've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but 
Hilarious 
All seemed wasted like deniro 's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
, light treat 
Also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes 
Its lack of purpose 
Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . ' 
Places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective 
A selection of scenes in search of a movie 
Less than the sum of its underventilated p��re-fils confrontations 
Meshes in this elegant entertainment 
're burnt out on it 's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol 
Promising 
Seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow 
The all-too-familiar dramatic arc 
Anchored by splendid performances 
Just a bunch of good actors 
Of attraction and interdependence 
What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
The gorgeously elaborate continuation 
Fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist 's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film . 
Else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie 
Is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks 
Mundane 
Sinister happy ending 
All its visual panache and compelling supporting characters 
A hilarious place to visit 
The engaging , 
Entertaining comedy 
Britney spears ' phoniness 
It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump 
The film has an infectious enthusiasm 
Is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out 
Seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business 
Of awakening and ripening 
Made eddie murphy a movie star and the man 
What it was that made the story relevant in the first place 
, at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
Stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it 
Walt becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
Brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project 
Good , sonny 
The characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm 
Hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism 
Delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride 
One teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and 
-- not the first , by the way -- 
, the director 's experiment is a successful one . 
High crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government / marine/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
About as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
Surprisingly refreshing 
Written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit 
None of them memorable 
As an entertainment destination for the general public 
Such an excellent job 
Catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them 
An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic 
More fascinating look 
Hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 
A fine , focused piece of work 
Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
Aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
Unmotivated 
Did n't convince me that calvin jr. 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago 's south side . 
Utilizes the idea of making kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . 
Lumbering 
Breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill 
Does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie 
Are masterfully controlled 
Is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul 
Ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor 
Stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
A sleek advert for youthful anomie 
As ' a perfect family film 
Finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers 
Hard to say who might enjoy this 
A successful example 
Of familial separation and societal betrayal 
Great credit 
Loneliness and isolation 
Are wasted in it 
The logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor . 
This is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
A first-class , thoroughly involving b movie 
A few tasty morsels 
Highly gifted 12-year-old 
Blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime 
Comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation 
A deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival 
A weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off 
May not be pleased 
It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't . 
Anti- 
Lacks it . 
Oral storytelling frozen onto film 
That should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans 
But quietly effective 
Into a dullard 
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized . 
The princess seem smug and cartoonish 
Are funny 
Characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
Hard to make the most of a bumper 
Terrific as rachel 
Can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 
Really stupid 
Ryan gosling ... is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
Guilt-trip 
, you wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours 
Two hours of junk . 
Human drama 
It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m��tier . 
... one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages 
Modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s the filmmakers could dredge up 
Far more interested in gross-out humor 
Diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
An unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage 
're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life 
Tries its best to hide the fact that seagal 's overweight and out of shape . 
Very top 
Sinks 
An uninspired preachy and clich��d war 
Keep this from being a complete waste of time 
Imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . 
's good enough to be the purr 
Is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
The smartest 
As the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided 
It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film 
Unlikable , 
Up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars 
An imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits 
Left on a remote shelf indefinitely 
A return to pure disney 
A movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well . 
Is phenomenal , especially the women 
Undercuts its charm 
It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it 
Larger-than-life figure 
Thrown every suspenseful clich�� in the book 
Rare and riveting 
A family film 
Elegant visual sense 
Are worth the price of admission 
Of being a good documentarian 
Very predictable but still entertaining 
A christmas perennial 
Depressing story

Have finally aged past his prime ... 
Do n't judge this one too soon 
Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen 
Rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film 's short 90 minutes . 
Consistently funny . 
Animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers 
A satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
Should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike 
Ca n't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
Its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
Be over 
The euphoria of growing up 
Constantly pulling the rug from underneath us 
Has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
Wince in embarrassment and others , 
On the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about 
That never catches fire 
Offensive 
It 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies . 
Celebrate 
Deepest recesses 
As good , if not better 
Throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit 
Quite tasty and inviting all the same 
Movies , television and the theater

It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch 
Is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
It 's an effort to watch this movie , 
Rapid-fire delivery 
Makes up for with its heart 
Effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles 
It takes chances that are bold by studio standards 
Opened it up for all of us to understand 
Imagine that most every aggrieved father clich�� has been unturned 
A worthy substitute 
In tatters 
No , even that 's too committed . 
Falling short as a whole 
There is no foundation for it 
Is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
've got a huge mess 
Have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup 
Complete waste 
Brow 
There are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie 
Snooze 
So poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines 
Sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty 
Handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
Too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book 
Manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance 
Flimsy 
Offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed 
Sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once 
People may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` chicago '' in 2002 . 
Unique and entertaining 
Sadly 
It should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .

Good fun 
While hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .

May be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
Is a tired one , 
Treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects 
Carry the film 
A worthless film 
At a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten 
Round out the square edges . 
A dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
To hate it 
Absorbs all manner of lame entertainment 
Eerily 
The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
Seedy clash 
Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
The sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
Payne has created a beautiful canvas 
Are the greatest musicians of all time . 
Labored writing and slack direction 
The old mib label stands for milder is n't better . 
The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess . 
Nicolas cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career 
Makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
The quirky 
Dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , 
As a mechanical apparatus 
Imaginatively 
Emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective 
For the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound 
Blasphemous and nonsensical 
A dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy 
Ranks as the most original in years 
Are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away 
) profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment 
Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . 
Ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
Recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
Like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you 're over 100 
In making me groggy 
The sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese 
Of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes 
Food-spittingly 
On top 
Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots 
Weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title . 
City by the sea would slip under the waves . 
Are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
Patchy 
It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag 
Ill-considered notion 
It 's easy to love robin tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
Might describe as a castrated 
Exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and 
No trouble sitting for blade ii 
It is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story 
Considered career-best performances 
A popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see 
The film is extremely thorough . 
Has some of the funniest jokes of any movie 
Celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light 
Farts , urine , feces , semen , or 
Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
Exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
Above the level of a telanovela 
, it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
Been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s the filmmakers could dredge up 
A glimmer of intelligence or invention 
The trap of the maudlin or tearful 
A vampire soap opera that does n't make much 
Provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway 
Letdown 
Jeunet 
Has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) 
A small movie with a big heart . 
One that should be thrown back in the river 
Trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Are fantasti 
A single man 's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music 
Wise and deadpan 
No , it 's not as single-minded as john carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . 
Surprisingly romantic 
, the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . 
In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
This woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , 
The unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
Fragmented film 
The chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones 
Attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire 
Appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus 
Boredom 
Terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it 's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
Is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood . 
A visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce 
Fun and 
's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts 
Works on no level whatsoever for me 
Shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski 's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high . 
Exceedingly pleasant 
Unflinching look 
About the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure 
Of new inspiration in it 
Predictable storyline and 
An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . 
Postcard perfect 
That did not figure out a coherent game 
's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest 
Recycles every clich�� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
( hayek ) throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and 
It 's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
Who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings 
Lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
Otherwise excellent film 
The biggest problem with roger avary 's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
When we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen 
Had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters 
A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
The goo 
Within the seas of their personalities 
Follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world 
The chatter 
Harsh 
For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence 
Strong 
Their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary 
In this marvelous film 
, there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
This a remarkable and novel concept 
First and 
Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
Of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while 
Monstrous 
Somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles 
Delivered in low-key style 
Candid , archly funny 
Any redeeming value whatsoever 
Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez 
Goes right 
Starts out with tremendous promise , 
Has humor and heart and very talented young actors 
Does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along 
About their budding amours 
You never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it 's a heck of a ride . 
Can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure 
A powerful sequel and 
All great films about a life you never knew existed 
We do n't get williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , 
Is n't funny . 
You-are-there immediacy 
It 's propelled by the acting 
Your interest , your imagination , your empathy 
Is a former film editor 
A riveting , brisk delight 
Is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children 
Sweet and 
Kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and 
Whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday 
A document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 
Even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . 
About as inspiring 
Keen eye , 
Oblivious 
Depress you about life itself 
There is a real subject here , and 
A sharp and quick documentary 
Oddly , the film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
On intimate relationships 
As literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment . 
To see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks 
Unambitious 
Straight to video 
In its characterizations 
No wrong 
Is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
Limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy 
Almost entirely witless and inane , 
Like schindler 's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
Special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
Vain for a movie 
The most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies 
It still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable 
75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie 
, the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey 
, it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
's much to recommend the film . 
The art direction is often exquisite , and 
Winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
The worst films 
This film , which may be why it works as well as it does 
Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . 
Its unerring respect for them 
True talent 
With terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor 
Peak 
Succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
Is never dull 
Is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
Accept it as life and 
A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
It can not even be dubbed hedonistic 
Not to mention absolutely refreshed . 
Said to squander jennifer love hewitt 
A single good film 
See nothing in it 
Explode 
Care 
Interesting effort 
, schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
Of its plot contrivances 
That ( nelson 's ) achievement does n't match his ambition 
Something awfully deadly 
Ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative 
Grinds itself out 
Receive 
Any other kind of intelligent humor 
A muddle 
Comes off as self-parody . 
Jay russell 
This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but 
A really special walk in the woods 
, this nervy oddity , like modern art should . 
Bland animated sequel 
In constant fits of laughter 
Emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
That 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood 
Unlike ( scorsese 's mean streets ) , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
Getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera 
Be the only one laughing at his own joke 
Gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
Makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
`` austin powers in goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
Achieving some honest insight into relationships 
One of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
Their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger 
That suck the audience in 
Energy and wit 
Real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is 
An engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it 
Return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company 
A much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- 
Dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue 
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill 
Is bright and flashy in all the right ways 
Imponderably stilted 
Of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey 
Both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters 
To see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen 
For sick and demented humor 
With a philosophical visual coming right 
Casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
Balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching 
Is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story 
The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds . 
Giggles 
Is that it 's actually watchable . 
What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch 
Mean-spirited second half 
, it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
Marvel again 
Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
Everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
Story is almost an afterthought 
Did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on 
Quite tasteful to look at 
A deft pace master 
With the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically 
Best little 
Simone is not a bad film . 
Precious new star wars movie 
That her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance 
My loved ones 
Skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional 
Radioactive hair 
What the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance . 
Looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it 
A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative 
To rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device 
Is small in scope , yet perfectly formed 
I thoroughly enjoyed the love story 
Romp pile 
Grows on you 
's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say 
The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . ' 
Humorless , self-conscious art drivel 
Arch and rather cold-blooded comedy 
The film buzz and whir ; 
Why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing 
Disgusted 
A genre that 's already a joke in the united states . 
Is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing 
Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
It 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
Beautifully shot , but 
Infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent 
As offensive 
Too many story lines 
A peculiar misfire that even tunney ca n't save . 
A discreet moan 
This is a heartfelt story 
Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... and 
This little $ 1.8 million charmer 
Easy to swallow , 
Has been made with an enormous amount of affection 
A kind of perpetual pain 
The film has an infectious enthusiasm and 
Might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
Venture forth 
Visually captivating . 
More sophisticated and literate than such pictures 
, signs is a tribute to shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
A first-class road movie 
Her good looks 
Biographical melodramas 
Lacking any sense of commitment to or 
's meandering , low on energy , and too eager 
To be seen as hip , winking social commentary 
Peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
There 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . 
Good guy 
A very good film 
Stultifying 
Great premise 
To figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that 
A summer 
Scuzzy 
Draws you 
Would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed 
Idea ( of middle-aged romance ) is not handled well and , 
The sketchiest 
The kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low 
Left me feeling refreshed and hopeful 
Intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular 
Hollow tribute 
To proceed as the world implodes 
Good-natured fun 
Hunky has-been 
Is serene , the humor wry and sprightly 
Derailed by bad writing 
Plus 
Neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear 
Surprisingly charming and even witty match 
The most severe kind 
The nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
Turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 
Pretty unbelievable 
It 's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
Touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport 
Good action , 
Remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written 
Too damn weird 
Has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- 
Defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome 
Lightweight female empowerment 
Should catch this imax offering . 
Catching solely on its visual merits 
I liked about schmidt a lot 
Painful improbability 
To see how far herzog has fallen 
As dahmer 
( seems ) even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
Had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny 
The elements were all there 
Overdone 
Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality 
Has created a brilliant motion picture 
A film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic 
Has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
For a winning , heartwarming yarn 
Whimsicality , narrative discipline 
Drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clich��s 
Lighting effects and innovative backgrounds 
Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Any of these despicable characters 
The rotting underbelly 
Yet , it must be admitted 
Charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent 
Lovably 
Will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
, and among the best films of the year . 
A valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view 
Seriously dumb characters , 
The burning sensation 
As chilling and fascinating as philippe mora 's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice . 
Martha enormously endearing 
Disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling 
The performances are amiable and committed , and 
Fixating 
Sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story 
While bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who are n't . 
Captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish 
It 's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
It has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
Riveting 
Maggie smith as the ya-ya member with the o2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment . 
With the inescapable conclusion 
Notorious rise 
Satisfyingly scarifying , 
To have their kids 
Could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 
Abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them 
The movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy 
Makes it a party worth attending . 
Disgusting to begin with 
That while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters 
As imaginative as one might have hoped 
Children and adults enamored of all things pokemon wo n't be disappointed . 
Due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
Is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice 
Bugged me 
Can tolerate leon barlow 
British comedy . 
The one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible 
Was worse . 
The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes 
Off too far 
Is so charmless and vacant 
Is far from disappointing 
Draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
Smoochy 
Delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . 
Of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
Drag it down to mediocrity -- 
Of the greatest date movies in years 
Too predictably 
A woozy quality 
None of which amounts to much of a story 
Too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction 
Is extremely thorough . 
Dead production 
A talented director 
Superficiality and 
A distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
You will likely enjoy this monster 
Assuredly 
Are underwhelming 
Always the prettiest pictures 
Giddy viewing 
Pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming 
Makes you feel like a chump 
Family-oriented 
Almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- 
Familiar situations and repetitive scenes 
Is a pretty decent little documentary 
, a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
A little melodramatic , but with enough 
Speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence 
Resolutely unamusing 
Cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin 
A confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
( gulpilil ) is a commanding screen presence , and his character 's abundant humanism makes him the film 's moral compass . 
Keenly 
Mr. haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience 
Lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
He brings together 
This film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
One reason it 's so lackluster 
An enjoyable comedy 
Give full performances 
A great idea 
Affecting , amusing , sad and reflective 
Except as a harsh conceptual exercise 
Is misbegotten 
Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters 
The lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring ... which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
The sensational true-crime 
Little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting 
The improperly hammy performance 
Followed through 
Many different ideas from happiness 
The scenes of torture and self-mutilation 
When it drags 
Cultural intrigue 
Heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
Flat , misguided comedy 
While the humor aspects of ` jason x ' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
To a picture-perfect beach 
An objective documentary 
's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
, sets the tone for a summer of good stuff 
Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters 
Are more involving than this mess . 
Intriguing questions 
A respectable new one 
More like a travel-agency video 
This humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie 
Scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug 
Serves as a rather thin moral 
Very ugly , very fast 
Poignant and 
Full of life and small delights 
Emptiness and maddeningly 
A main character who sometimes defies sympathy 
Begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends 
Infuriating 
Been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) 
If you 're willing to have fun with it , you wo n't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
Ultimate insignificance 
Which may be why it works as well as it does 
Those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party 
Rather than provocative 
Of the movie 's charm 
Succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
In its own direction 
An appalling ` ace ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton 
The characters are based on stock clich��s , and 
, like i already mentioned ... it 's robert duvall ! 
Have been lost in the translation this time 
Bertrand tavernier 's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( `` laissez-passer '' ) 
Spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream 
Leguizamo and jones are both excellent and 
Will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but 
Some fairly unsettling scenes 
Fascinating and 
With results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , 
Long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare 
Remains the real masterpiece 
A plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project 
Even when crush departs from the 4w formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash . 
God bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star 
Banality 
The passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists 
The price of admission for the ridicule factor 
It 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously 
Is a fragmented film 
Magnificent 
Manic and energetic 
The best irish sense 
Comfortably 
Grant is certainly amusing , 
In increasingly incoherent fashion 
And moving portrait 
Franchise possibilities 
's on par with the first one 
To share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle 
Thoughtless , random , superficial humor and a lot of very bad scouse accents 
It 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
This trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it 
Make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them 
Caring for animals and respecting other cultures 
The film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken . 
Effective in all its aspects , margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken . 
The dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal 
Ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
The wit and hoopla 
Is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn 
Would leave you cold 
Two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
A deeply unpleasant experience 
Another example of how sandler is losing his touch 
( dong ) makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , 
In the midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to 
Comes out on video 
Has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong 
Spreading a puritanical brand of christianity 
Gentle , mesmerizing portrait 
Is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love . 
, to say nothing of boring . 
In this film , which may be why it works as well as it does 
A major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche 
Unholy hokum . 
The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
Have to give them credit for : the message of the movie 
Whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story 
Perfect comic timing 
Be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes 
Wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
A riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey 
It is a good and ambitious film 
Could have -- should have 
Too dry 
It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
Stay in touch with your own skin 
Does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly 
Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
A long , dull procession of despair 
Lack contrast 
The movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences 
) best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america 
Pollute the summer movie pool 
's not a fresh idea 
A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
Lowbrow 
Left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else 
While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics ) 
Teen-speak and animal gibberish 
This deeply moving french drama 
An athlete , a movie star , 
Not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
Works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by india 's popular gulzar and jagjit singh 
Of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
Spirit is a visual treat 
Display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline 
How a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
The pathetic idea 
Going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn 
95-minute commercial 
Pure adrenalin 
Puts wang at the forefront of china 's sixth generation of film makers 
Seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain 
The relationships were wonderful 
This `` un-bear-able '' project 
Humorless and 
Positively shakesperean 
Offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s 
Ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . 
Even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin 
Own preciousness 
Humanism 
And even touching 
Painfully forced , false and fabricated 
Fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling 
Does n't completely 
A good alternative 
Hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character 's gripping humanity . 
By having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once 
In the pianist 
The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle 
More appropriate 
The final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
Depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable 
If you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or 
, painful , obnoxious 
More interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us 
But is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
One of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself 
Dramatized pbs program 
An enjoyable above average summer diversion 
Sucking you in ... 
It would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is 
, the movie is certainly easy to watch . 
A tiny sense of hope 
Delicious dialogue 
Prevails 
Allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie 
Splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
Of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story 
Most irresponsible 
Quirky comedy 
Is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level 
Affectionately goofy 
Has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers . 
Might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead 
Managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan 
Ultimately losing cause 
Warm and winning 
Is completely 
Is just too original to be ignored 
Best 60 minutes 
Flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity 
Are all in the performances , from foreman 's barking-mad taylor to thewlis 's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell 's hard-eyed gangster 
That caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion 
Nudity , profanity and violence 
Directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin 
A besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new 
Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture 
Like arnold schwarzenegger 
Monumental achievement 
Murphy 's expert comic timing 
Lacks considerable brio 
Delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for 
Is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
In this flat effort 
The dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film 
Trite 
This ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but 
The lack-of-attention span 
Adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
Makes little attempt 
Of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film 
By forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note 
We do n't avert our eyes for a moment . 
's also uninspired , 
Shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski 's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high 
A touching love story 
A gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic 
's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community 
Too fluffy 
Rent this on video 
A treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you 're a struggling nobody . 
Dwindles . 
Is powerful and provocative . 
An honest attempt to get at something 
Its botches 
Inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence 
Boring and obvious 
Is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material 
... director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
These characters love each other 
Benefit enormously from the cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances 
An engrossing and grim portrait 
It 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
Bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
Punctuated by sudden shocks 
Its otherwise comic narrative 
Reenacting a historic scandal 
Is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride . 
Ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking 
Will talk about for hours . 
The-night 
As the most original in years 
From start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves 
Adam sandler 's heart may be in the right place 
Why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
Regardless of race 
's not nearly enough that 's right 
, the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
The intensity 
About as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy 
Feels like a spectator and not a participant 
Adorably ditsy but heartfelt 
The performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing 
Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos 
The film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror 
Modern-day comedies 
Sloppy script 
Not only is it hokey 
Biggest disappointments 
Enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit 
In the screenplay to keep the film entertaining 
Glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior 
Has moments of inspired humor , 
Sensuous and

Too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category 
About as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man 
A sweet , tender sermon 
Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout . 
A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma 
You enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright 
Of tastelessness and gall 
Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it 
Life 's harshness 
Much about the film , including some of its casting , 
Long-lived friendships

Sit through it all 
Holds the screen like a true star 
The emperor 's club , ruthless in its own placid way 
Fantasy 
Turn on many people to opera , in general 
No obvious escape 
Laugh riot 
That should n't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience 
Been done before but never so vividly 
Long and relentlessly saccharine film 
The film can depress you about life itself . 
Botching a routine assignment 
This like the dreaded king brown snake 
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
A creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... 
Is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
Upper west sidey 
, it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
On its own , big trouble could be considered a funny little film . 
's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition 
Both people 's capacity 
Be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering 
Of good old-fashioned escapism 
Brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke 's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away 
A bracing 
Stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense 
Would tax einstein 's brain 
The paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- 
Until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 
This particular , anciently demanding m��tier 
Brings this unknown slice of history affectingly 
Which is worth seeing 
Especially disappointing 
As lazy 
Is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
They were insulted and 
Would go back and choose to skip it . 
An interesting storyline 
Harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
Succeed in really rattling the viewer 
Flabby 
Flashy 
Numb experience of watching o fantasma 
The backstage angst 
Immature character 
Busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
Preposterous moments 
Cruel 
That are more silly than scary 
At 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer 
Will make you laugh 
Remarkable for its intelligence and intensity . 
's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama 
Complex , laden with plenty of baggage and 
Visually 
A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
Is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
Easily forgotten 
A lighthearted glow , 
Lousy direction 
Her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset 
Bruised 
As epic tragedy 
Enthusiasm , 
For adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover 
Entertaining and audacious moments 
Long and unfocused 
Try hard but 
Fresh air 
-- and disposable story -- 
Makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes 
's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
Clever and 
Only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be 
An evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream 
To be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time 
Drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes 
The best korean film of 2002 
A severe case of hollywood-itis 
Can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it 
Is left slightly unfulfilled . 
That just does n't work 
The big ending surprise 
Mostly honest 
Too dry and too placid 
To blow it 
Ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
( evans is ) a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
We care about the story 
Another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
Why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
Screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame 
A fun one 
Crazy , mixed-up films 
A bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer 
A level of connection and concern 
The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing 
There is a great deal of fun . 
It is quite a vision . 
A winning , heartwarming yarn 
Might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
Fairly basic comedic constructs 
Seen this summer 
Ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least 
, somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
A shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( woo 's ) best work 
Waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , 
's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second 
A heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted 
The worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking 
A bittersweet film , 
Of an authentic feel 
Flaccid 
A huge box-office hit in korea 
Horribly depressing 
Is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
Restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy 
Like a documentary in the way 
The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny 
A slick , engrossing melodrama . 
... the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
Over-indulgent tirade 
Songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel 
, these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
Engaging mystery 
Flat effort 
Dramatically satisfying 
Uncommonly moving 
Makes the move from pleasing 
It 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
Bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing 
The worst film of the year . 
Funny , puzzling movie 
Rich and intelligent 
Hope and magic 
One of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once . 
Rattling the viewer 
Gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game 
Must-see 
In the rush of slapstick thoroughfare 
Does n't know what it wants to be 
Stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
More fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies 
Treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds 
Absurdist spider web . 
Refuses to spell things out for viewers 
Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
You might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion 
Not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but 
A '' range 
Staring 
This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen 
Of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation 
It makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
All leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn 
Uneven performances 
Sometimes inadequate performances 
Have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted 
Breathes more on the big screen 
Humbling little film 
Only thing missing 
Humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath 's version of ` nicholas nickleby ' 
Are oscar-size 
Liked it just enough . 
Such a well-defined sense 
, should n't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
Casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
Those who are n't put off by the film 's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
Inspiration and ambition 
Inexplicable nightmare 
The delight of discovery 
Enough cool 
The memorable character creations 
Preserves tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera 
Meandering , low on energy , and too eager 
Also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction 
Me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here 
Shoplifts 
Assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
Notice the 129-minute running time 
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , 
Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents 
As simultaneously funny , 
Very funny romantic comedy 
The latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film 
Dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time 
When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails . 
Hatosy ... portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
Raucous and sappy 
Arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel 
Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny . 
's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke 
'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence 
That was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival 
In the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison 
Out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
Could have been crisper and punchier , but it 's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies 
Do n't have a clue on the park . 
It 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and 
A delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score 
One that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches 
A fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard ... and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels .

Magnetic as graham 
Loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy 
The big ending surprise almost saves the movie . 
Inventive 
The way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
But even then , i 'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes .

Single good film 
Director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j. wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time . 
An inventive , absorbing movie that 's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
Communicate the truth of the world around him 
In trouble every day

Wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate 
Moments of hilarity 
Is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure 
Is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care 
An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about 
Genuinely worthwhile 
Is rather pretentious 
The nightmare of war 
Marks the spot .

If you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox 
Deep or substantial 
Veered off too far into the exxon zone , 
Out on video before month 's end 
Even bother to rent this on video 
Is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity . 
Its refusal to recognize any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map 
Is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny 
Avalanche 
Be distasteful to children and adults 
Everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness 
Amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but 
It 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
Elegant work 
Naivet�� and sophistication

Swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s.c. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
Feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun .

The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images 
So much first-rate talent 
Shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film . 
Exciting 
Shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
Indie of the year 
Call it magic 
Crappy 
A pretty good job 
But fails to keep it up and settles into clich��s 
With an undeniable energy 
Hitler 's destiny 
Then you 'd do well to check this one out because it 's straight up twin peaks action ... 
Is nothing redeeming about this movie 
Throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
Interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul 's perspective 
Innuendo 
The absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us 
To wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching 
Dreamed up 
Everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
Best case 
Thrills the eye 
Too little excitement and 
Monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
Riveting set pieces 
Leave a large dog alone 
Entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves 
Soulless 
, all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
Passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge 
Be pleasant in spite of its predictability 
That 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics 
Oftentimes funny , yet 
Are alternately touching and funny 
Sweaty-palmed fun 
The layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light 
A sloppy script 
No chemistry or engaging charisma 
Of the grief 
Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs. sever , were made for the palm screen 
Inspired '' 
Beautiful canvas 
Imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , 
The search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering . 
Gushing -- 
A good music documentary , 
To steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
But something far more stylish and cerebral -- and 
Sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop 
A breakthrough in filmmaking 
A plodding teen remake 
Naive 
An edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era 
Cynical 
Assayas ' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation 
Chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
Alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
Absurdity 
Whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation 
The end that extravagantly redeems it 
Garbage 
Schmaltzy and clumsily 
The banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid 
To recommend it 
An incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud 
Got it right 
That wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
If you 've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse 
Bottom-of-the-bill fare 
Like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
Is so often nearly nothing 
To bodacious 
A more credible script , 
He allows nothing to get in the way 
Comes up shorter than britney 's cutoffs . 
Effortless performance 
, virulent and foul-natured 
( gosling 's ) combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence 
` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and 
Surprises or delights 
Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish 
Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary 
's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
Honest observations 
The film 's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but 
Where it plainly has no business going 
The franchise 's best years are long past 
Filter out the complexity 
( a ) rather thinly-conceived movie . 
And diesel is n't the actor to save it . 
A not-so-divine secrets 
Spend with these people 
I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone . 
Should be doing a lot of things , but does n't 
From seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell 
, and larded with exposition 
Generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
Simple , poignant and leavened 
's definite room for improvement 
're going to face frightening late fees 
Fun and reminiscent 
Shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement 
An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike 
Never comes close to recovering from its demented premise 
Of the year 's best films 
's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages 
Scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . 
Addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row 
It 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
Dull and 
A cartoon ? 
Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
The year 's best films 
The threat implied in the title pok��mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming 
, then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable 
Off-beat 
The movie 's set 
Fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious 
With humor and lightness

Terrific job 
May pander to our basest desires for payback 
Still show virtually no understanding of it 
As the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera 's drama and lyricism 
This movie makes one thing perfectly clear 
Splendid production design 
The ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen 
Who can out-bad-act the other 
Has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
Veracity 
Strong script 
George orwell turning over 
Puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula . 
Mean 
A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
Into such fresh territory 
It is cruel 
Of empathy for its characters

This film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , 
It 's such a mechanical endeavor ( that ) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .

That started with a great premise and then just fell apart

Uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter

A devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .

You watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
Its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work . 
Diane lane 's sophisticated performance 
Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
The still-inestimable contribution 
Elbowed aside by one-liners 
Can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art . 
Innocent , childlike and inherently funny

Fourth-rate 
A big , juicy role 
Though filmed partly in canada , paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years . 
And in a sense , that 's a liability .

Spectacularly ugly-looking 
Brash , intelligent 
There are n't many conclusive answers in the film 
The shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge 
A well-done film

The movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and 
Lots of cute animals and clumsy people 
It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
Is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of variety 
A decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- 
's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
An unpleasantly 
Over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own 
Can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head 
In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
Winningly 
Funny moment 
Robert duvall 
Because there is no foundation for it 
A breath 
Tastelessness 
, the country bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
Pack a powerful emotional wallop 
It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
Eviction 
Addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage 
Such a stultifying 
Looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel 
Take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he 'll be your slave for a year 
I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that 
Atypically hypnotic 
Charming and evoking 
All , a great party 
Instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture 
If you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller 
Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , 
Drown yourself 
Well worth watching 
Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling 
That it 's a brazenly misguided project 
Written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience 
Exceedingly rare films 
Best sports movie 
Struck a chord in me 
Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid 
Director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters . 
The movie is rather choppy . 
Successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling . 
Art film 
Both sitcomishly predictable and cloying 
Salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
There is greatness here . 
Movie sputters 
Not to like about a movie with a ` children 's ' song that includes the line ` my stepdad 's not mean , he 's just adjusting ' 
Brave , uninhibited performances 
The cinematic canon 
, look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls 
Fun . 
The best looking and stylish 
Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
, but your ego 
Juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks 
Brilliantly constructed work . 
K-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories 
, queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
Enjoyable comedy 
It looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
Need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry 
All the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) 
's lots of cool stuff packed into espn 's ultimate x. 
Charmless and 
Mean-spirited 
Lopez romantic comedy 
Mira nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery 
Its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls 
Verges on the amateurish 
They help increase an average student 's self-esteem 
It makes your teeth hurt 
Labored gags 
You wish you had n't seen 
Stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy 
Wo n't be sorry 
Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue 
Because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks 
Wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned 
Have required genuine acting from ms. spears 
Saddled 
, unforced 
Has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise 
Human nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
Try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
Scoob 
A successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist 
Delights 
( has ) an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 's all true . 
Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick . 
An insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief 
Make you reach for the tissues 
A lousy script , 
's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone 
Some serious issues 
It 's a wonderful life marathons and bored 
Will linger long after this film has ended . 
Has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films 
Will please eastwood 's loyal fans -- 
Elegantly colorful look 
Sappy and amateurish 
A deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . 
, this movie proves you wrong on both counts . 
Of family tradition and familial community 
When it comes to the battle of hollywood vs. woo , it looks like woo 's a p.o.w. 
Of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface 
Utter mush ... 
A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics 
, this is the one . 
A terrific job 
Knowledge , education , and 
All of this , and more 
Lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
Paranoid and unlikable 
Robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
Tells a fascinating , compelling story 
An intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love 
And engaging film 
Trembling and gratitude 
The grandeur of the best next generation episodes 
Nothing else to watch 
A journey back to your childhood 
Fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , 
Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism 
Feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
Tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock 
, it 's as good as you remember . 
Spiffy bluescreen technique 
Most frantic , virulent and foul-natured 
Rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over 
Wo n't be sitting through this one again 
To a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie 
We 're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she 's french 
Of the things costner movies are known for 
That wind-in-the-hair exhilarating 
To finally revel in its splendor 
A captivating new film . 
Is simply too overdone . 
Greatly enhances the quality of neil burger 's impressive fake documentary . 
, with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling . 
Zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that 's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does 
Play one lewd scene after another 
Why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
A copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life 
Violent , vulgar and forgettably 
The , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
Is a tribute to shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project 
Deeply appealing 
You 'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
Shrill and soporific , and because 
'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
This slick and sprightly cgi feature 
Is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief . 
There is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
A decent-enough nail-biter 
Trying to create something original 
Redeemed 
Tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel 
For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
Leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb 
Utilizes the idea of making kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work 
Drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage 
Killer soundtrack 
With wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender 
Anchoring

Plodding ,

Compelling enough 
Bad behavior 
The writing is indifferent , and 
Only so much baked cardboard 
Four star performance 
Sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material . 
Takes its title all too literally 
Is surprisingly brilliant , 
Lighthearted 
It 's plotless , shapeless -- and

Enough of interest onscreen 
More unmentionable subjects 
Overcome the triviality of the story 
Thoroughly engrossing 
That 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant 's two best films 
Why ? 
Uselessly 
It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , 
Is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans . 
The santa clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
A bit of a phony relationship 
Buzz , blab and money 
Floundering way 
Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction 
Those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up 
The dutiful precision of a tax accountant 
The superficial way it deals with its story 
Makes it seem fresh again . 
Neat premise 
Directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured 
Bloody 
Completely ridiculous 
The success 
A superlative b movie -- 
A very old-school kind 
What 's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
Otherwise talented 
After the clever credits roll 
Of a river of sadness that pours into every frame 
Does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies 
Probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises 
Like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend 
Dreary tale of middle-class angst 
The viewer 's patience with slow pacing and 
Less of a trifle 
It works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
An 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long

One of the rarest kinds of films

Where santa gives gifts to grownups 
The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , 
A possible argentine american beauty reeks

Jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and 
Awful sour taste 
A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
An honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair 
Vision is beginning to feel 
Is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she 'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams 
What ( frei ) gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
A captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless 
Unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
She had to sit through it again 
Definitely gives you something to chew on 
More unattractive or odorous 
That assumes you are n't very bright 
While adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special 
Dead dog 
That is beyond playing fair with the audience 
Degrades its characters , its stars and its audience

Music and laughter 
Satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but 
Grayish 
His craft 
Than to show us a good time 
An interesting bit 
As pure over-the-top trash 
In the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice 
Horrible 
The downward spiral comes to pass 
Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ... 
's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty 
Smarter and much 
Beginning to resemble someone 's crazy french grandfather 
Not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
Sheer dumbness 
A return to form for director peter bogdanovich 
Deeply touched by this movie 
Anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair 
Of bewitched that takes place during spring break 
The performances are an absolute joy . 
A gorgeous film - 
Plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' 
A stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie 
Told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue 
Unsettling , memorable cinematic experience 
The best war movies 
Has done excellent work here .

Win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews 
A deeper story 
Think this movie loves women at all 
Unwary viewers 
Sweetness , clarity and emotional openness 
Every bad action-movie line in history 
Humor and heart 
Quietly affecting cop drama 
Unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
In some evocative shades 
Only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` ah , yes 
That a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer 
Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
It 's leaden and predictable , 
Many of these gross 
In telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal 
Seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film 
Both damning and damned compelling . 
That `` gangs '' is never lethargic

, cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
( `` safe conduct '' ) is a long movie at 163 minutes 
A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . 
Enticing and often funny documentary 
It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
Half past dead is just such an achievement . 
The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
That watching it leaves you giddy 
Provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket 
This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses 
Offers some flashy twists and 
Scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf 
All arty and jazzy 
Heart-pounding 
Fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters . 
Manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie 
The death of self ... this orgasm ( wo n't be an ) exceedingly memorable one for most people 
The gags are often a stitch . 
Unusual but unfortunately also 
None of this is meaningful or memorable 
Fantastically 
All he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon 
With such good humor 
Tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
A trove of delights 
Part of the film 's cheeky charm 
A more balanced or fair portrayal 
Potent 
Transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories 
Going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together 
For its elegantly colorful look and sound 
`` orange county '' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
And that is where ararat went astray . 
Bull sessions

Own quirky hipness 
A bad run in the market or a costly divorce 
Painful to watch 
Been so aggressively anti-erotic

Warm , enveloping affection

Lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade 
Worthy entry 
Sleeper 
Speaks volumes , 
Peculiarly 
Providing no real sense of suspense 
A torrent of emotion 
Does no justice to the story itself 
Like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
Involve a dentist drill 
A pitch-perfect holden 
A sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public 
Self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
Pretty weary

Grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond 
Exceeds 
Compressed characterisations 
Watery tones 
An important , original talent 
One of mr. chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny 
That watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement 
Time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
For beginners 
Shining with all the usual spielberg flair , 
Ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
An unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get 
Do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes

Appetizing 
It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
Is certainly amusing 
See this terrific film with your kids 
Pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations 
The obligatory outbursts of flatulence and 
Curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner 
, manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
Not to believe it 
To escape the shackles of its own clich��s to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks 
Fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency . 
Provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals 
Genuine narrative 
Collapses when mr. taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush 
This sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman 's warmest . 
The series ' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives 
This is the best star trek movie in a long time . 
Presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years .

Mournful 
If you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you 're at the right film . 
The histrionic muse 
Get paid enough to sit through crap like this 
's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here 
Its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction 
Ultimately satisfies with its moving story 
Most romantic comedies , 
With few respites 
Kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
A tired , unnecessary retread ... 
Is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
Guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor .

Images even more haunting than those in mr. spielberg 's 1993 classic 
Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
The right movie 
Too literally 
Has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . 
A flat script and 
, it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
Is delightful in the central role . 
Fearless purity 
Falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting 
Beneath it 
Takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
More elves and snow and 
Stiff and 
Is n't as funny 
Is high on squaddie banter , low 
Like the rock on a wal-mart budget 
If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . 
Puts washington , as honest working man john q. archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher 
, all credibility flies out the window . 
A good chance 
It 's a masterpiece . 
Pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans 
` the chateau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . ' 
Its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and 
The leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
Catch me '' feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
Pointless , stupid

It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , 
To be bored by as your abc 's 
Realize there 's no place for this story to go but down

The animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
Is painful to watch 
Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue 
As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
Pushed to their most virtuous limits , 
Sick sight 
Over-dramatic 
Cheapen the overall effect 
Is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them 
Is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .

The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` baran . ' 
Angel of death 
Of gentle longing 
Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 
It 's a scorcher . 
An empty exercise

No matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence 
Full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing

Visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .

Magnificent swooping aerial shots 
Smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
I love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . 
Just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
Is simply not enough of interest onscreen 
A deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . 
The writing is clever

There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work

Recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
Brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .

Mira nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences

If the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek )

Of intelligent humor 
Weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , 
Broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture 
Of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically 
That manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography 
Most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up 
Goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers

A tour de force 
About something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern 
Surprisingly sweet and gentle 
Results from adhering to the messiness of true stories 
Is enormously good fun 
Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen 
The absurdity of the premise 
An extraordinary poignancy 
Was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
If you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera 
Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
Feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series 
Ca n't wait to see what the director does next 
Passionate and 
The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
Hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring 
Buffoons 
The mediocre end 
Denzel washington 's fine performance 
Finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground 
Undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
A casual intelligence that permeates the script 
Perfectly clear 
Ben kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad . 
Every suspenseful clich�� in the book 
Getting the better of obnoxious adults

What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
That mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 
Absolutely 
It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids 
( the film ) works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
But it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker . 
Something to be taken seriously 
's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison 
The mundane 
` god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . ' 
Allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , 
Takes off in totally unexpected directions 
Manipulative and as bland 
Is so convincing that by movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
That the final product is a ghost 
Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , i 'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , 
Having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
No palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes 
The soggy performances 
As the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful

A strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor 
From the ages 
Makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
A plethora of engaging diatribes

Robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
Uncool the only thing missing is the `` gadzooks ! '' 
The first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it 's actually watchable . 
Exhilarating , 
Where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
It 's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
Check your pulse .

High-spirited buddy movie 
The hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him 
A fun 
Sleazy moralizing 
Is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs 
Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride . 
Heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
That is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film 
Gets around to its real emotional business , 
Hey , happy ! 
To see this terrific film with your kids -- if you do n't have kids borrow some 
Clever and very satisfying picture 
The humor aspects of ` jason x ' were far more entertaining than i had expected 
Amusing , sad and reflective

As boring before i see this piece of crap again 
Are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor 's doorstep . 
In its crapulence 
Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , 
A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .

Parapsychological

Is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves 
A catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall

Bad at a fraction the budget 
Interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic 
On and on to the point of nausea 
Lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
Endear itself 
Of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theater 
Is fantastic 
The film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful 
Because it has a bigger-name cast 
The high standards 
Broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . 
Inescapable absurdities 
Of outrageous force and craven concealment 
Is capped with pointless extremes

Vivid , convincing performances

's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible 
Transcend genre 
Deftly captures 
If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
High standards 
Its clumsiness 
, it is a great film . 
Even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly 
Me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch 
In its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace 
Thanks to the presence 
A completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
Forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
Genre a bad name 
The only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear . 
My least favorite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
There are some laughs in this movie 
Just does n't have big screen magic 
Mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant 
Potent exploration 
Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ... 
Can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
It with ring , an indisputably spooky film 
The sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
Does little here but point at things that explode into flame 
Unholy 
As immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful 
Often demented in a good way , 
Capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves 
4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . 
An extremely flat lead performance 
This is dicaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
Is almost entirely witless and inane ,

Own idiosyncratic way 
The movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .

Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .

With grace and humor and 
A director who understands how to create and sustain a mood

You 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
A remarkably cohesive whole , 
Slack complacency 
Is the piece works brilliantly . 
Minimal appreciation 
Lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires 
Even better 
, the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .

Made up for its rather slow beginning 
Quite the genre-busting film 
Guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
Episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust 
As you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , 
What punk 
The sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash 
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but

The film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but 
Of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller 
A heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he 'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego .

Pathetic , starving and untalented 
Builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia 
Get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen 
, period-perfect biopic hammers 
Much worse than bland or better than inconsequential 
It wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three 
An emotionally accessible , almost mystical work 
Discover that the answer is as conventional as can be 
Never clearly defines his characters 
What sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway 's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
If uneven , 
Wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion 
, the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
All about anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect 
, it would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
Is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality 
, lifeless 
A potentially incredibly twisting mystery 
A poor fit 
Credible gender-provoking philosophy 
Wisely 
Energetic and smart 
This was lazy but enjoyable 
Suffers from a flat script and a low budget 
Brash , intelligent and 
Represents two of those well spent 
Efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
Ourside the theater roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he 's well worth spending some time with 
That seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
Make this an eminently engrossing film . 
Mr. schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
A gracious , eloquent film 
Is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance 
To gorgeous beaches 
It searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say 
Skims over the realities of gay sex 
, low-wattage 
A true cinematic knack 
Of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film 
A one-star rating 
An engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary . 
Is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
Drug culture 
Not a hollywood product 
A whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs 
It has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson 
Over his head 
Pays tribute 
Disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service 
Laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and 
The acting is amateurish , 
The film that surprises or delights 
, it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie 
Waiting for things 
Speaks for itself 
To jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending 
... a pretentious mess ... 
Wildly alive 
Companionable 
Brightly optimistic 
The feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art 
Even less capable trio 
Turning into a black hole of dullness 
Emerges as a numbingly dull experience 
Original nor terribly funny 
Minded patience , respect and affection 
Sweet home alabama is n't going to win any academy awards 
Mindless action 
Is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
Is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut 
Should definitely get top billing 
A scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most 
Viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances 
To go around , with music and laughter 
Two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
On an inferior level 
Frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds 
Go hand in hand 
Manage to be spectacularly outrageous . 
A calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter 
An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza 
A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
Premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings 
Best short story writing 
A rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half 
Characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time 
A pleasant and engaging enough sit 
The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
Particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull 
Captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes 
That they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , 
The thornier aspects 
Of cliches 
Are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
Puts the sting back into the con 
An engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement 
Thoroughly satisfying entertainment 
It 's great for the kids 
To absurd lengths 
Absurdities and clich��s 
A beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions 
'' is entertaining . 
Does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
Oddly honest 
Visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure . 
Less of a trifle if ms. sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine 
In my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
Its 112-minute length 
Drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category 
Little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding 
Issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 
The top japanese animations of recent vintage 
Little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , 
A courageous scottish lady 
About how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities 
Most daring , 
Without sacrificing its high-minded appeal 
Not once does it come close to being exciting . 
A rambling and incoherent manifesto 
Claim to express warmth and longing 
About a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings 
, they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either . 
Undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice 
A directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans 
The masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments 
The film for anyone 
About changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza 
's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart 
... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
Hooks us completely 
'' has been written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit ! '' 
Through this mess 
A schlocky creature 
Director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about drumline is its energy . 
Employs to authenticate her british persona 
Davis ' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 
Imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty 
Has a flair for dialogue comedy 
Lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 
Fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality 
Watching a rerun 
The enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , 
Masochism 
The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
As the slight , pale mr. broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover 
This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . 
Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs 
To become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) 
Loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
A simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm . 
Daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story 
Its intelligence and intensity 
Poignant and moving 
Captivating . 
Bombshell 
Rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' 
Some clever scripting solutions 
Major pleasures 
Sick and demented humor 
Should appreciate its whimsical humor 
Humanly funny film 
Is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley 's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
A funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving 
Truly distinctive 
Is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
A lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell 
An intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries 
Head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work 
One of my greatest pictures , drunken master 
The best next generation episodes 
It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .

Entirely memorable 
Been called freddy gets molested by a dog 
Mindless 
A been-there , 
That is sure to win viewers ' hearts 
This self-deprecating , biting and witty feature 
Told with competence 
Is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus 
As far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds 
Soul-searching garbage . 
Sharper , cleaner script 
Generally a huge fan 
Really busts out of its comfy little cell 
... the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
That i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british

Iconic 
The wise-beyond-her-years teen 
Of liveliness 
Have finally aged past his prime ... and , 
Hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . 
This obscenely bad dark comedy , 
Schneidermeister ... makin ' a fool of himself 
Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , 
Colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical 
Is genuinely inspirational 
Most thoughtful fictional examination 
How can you charge money for this ? ' 
The ultimate scorsese film 
Heightened , well-shaped dramas

Plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael 
A breakthrough 
Listless , witless , and 
Excels in spectacle and pacing . 
To recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
A fully engaged supporting cast 
Low-rent -- and even lower-wit 
'' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
Unknowable 
A spirit that can not be denied 
Disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh 
Be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera 
You 'll still have a good time . '' 
The modern rut of narrative banality 
Has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation . 
If you open yourself up to mr. reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
Cram too many ingredients 
Great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense 
What redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . 
Thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett 's familiar quotations 
A solid movie about people whose lives are anything but 
It an above-average thriller 
Impossible spot 
Dave barry 's popular book of the same name 
As unusually and unimpressively fussy 
Too much exploitation 
One key problem with these ardently christian storylines 
A film in a class with spike lee 's masterful 
Furious 
Saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) 
Have to admit i walked out of runteldat 
The film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure 
Style and 
Crisp and purposeful 
Cute animals 
A nifty plot line in steven soderbergh 's traffic 
Is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
Hugely enjoyable in its own right 
Wo n't enjoy the movie at all . 
Recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes 
Depressing 
Pull us deep into the girls ' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that 's opened between them . 
Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much 
Violent and mindless 
Taking angry potshots at george w. bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . 
Interested 
A worthwhile documentary , 
Pedestrian 
Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
Scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious 
Buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie 
He 's the god of second chances ' 
A high-end john hughes comedy 
Made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters 
Is rich in emotional texture 
That director m. night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and 
Inimitable 
Has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
With the same number of continuity errors 
Extraordinarily rich 
Ultimate movie experience 
The case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
Pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and 
Old-fashioned in all the best possible ways 
Never succumbs to sensationalism 
Spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
Will be well worth your time . 
A very good viewing alternative for young women 
Interesting enough

Plucks 
Quirky movie to be made from curling 
This is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
The shackles of its own clich��s 
Soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr. drew barrymore 
This is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .

A big heart 
Stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel . 
The personal touch of manual animation 
Demons 
If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
Leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors . 
Gives `` mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling 
Very compelling , sensitive 
Like kissing jessica stein , amy 's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
Contradiction 
Trudge 
In many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience 
Do n't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role 
Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . 
In fact , the best in recent memory 
A kind of hard , cold effect 
Clever in spots 
Is as delightful as it is derivative 
Has it beat by a country mile 
With dickens ' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath 's even-toned direction 
The more you will probably like it . 
The unnamed , easily substitutable forces 
The needlessly poor quality 
Be distinguished from a mediocre one 
Has never looked uglier . 
Need comforting fantasies about mental illness 
Rage and alienation 
Very stupid and annoying . 
Thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

Heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable 
Too neat and new pin-like 
Scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , 
A monumental achievement 
Sweet 
Brainless , 
Waters it down , 
Ludicrous and contrived plot 
, it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
Probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists 
Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment 
Gets bogged down over 140 minutes 
Started with a great premise and then just fell apart 
A dashing and resourceful hero ; 
Avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
Complicated plotting and banal dialogue 
The big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
Ineffable 
Failings 
Metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
The characters sound like real people 
Standout performance 
Comatose 
, warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
An inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition 
Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
` cultural revolution 
The price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film 
Come even easier . 
Fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved 
Hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit 
Mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material 
The answer is as conventional as can be 
Human nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart 
Recommend it 
The charisma and ability 
Uneven 
So lackluster 
Natalie babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel 
Never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
Is its essential problem 
Caffeinated , sloppy brilliance 
What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
Seem fresh again 
The sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film . 
Being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams 
The screenplay , but rather 
For independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood 
We get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized . 
Remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg 's misunderstood career . 
A nasty aftertaste but little clear memory 
A little old-fashioned storytelling

The most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter 
Become a household name 
Invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs 
Fit in any modern action movie 
Rich in emotional texture 
As if it belongs on the big screen 
The production details are lavish 
Mr. goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction 
An ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast 
As action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson 's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff�� and demi moore 
Unimaginable demons 
Goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly 
These people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
Should get all five 
Hackery 
But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
The point of nausea 
Realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject . 
Be of interest primarily to its target audience 
Blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance 
Just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided 
Going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films 
Deserves , at the very least , 
Its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
Leave this loser 
's no accident 
Manufactured to me and artificial 
Delicious , quirky movie 
Everyone 's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships . 
Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country 
Emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing 
It 's not particularly well made 
, and unforgettable characters 
A sad , soggy potboiler 
The overall fabric is hypnotic , and 
Also is difficult to fathom . 
Busts out of its comfy little cell 
That hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
Companion 
The rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language 
Through the constraints of its source 
Laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy 
Aimless for much of its running time , 
The superficial tensions 
The charm of satin rouge 
That it looks neat 
Across as shallow and glib though 
After several scenes of this tacky nonsense 
You 're left with a sour taste in your mouth 
Funniest and most accurate depiction

Strong filmmaking 
Foolish choices 
Celebratory 
About otherwise dull subjects 
Funny and human 
Such conviction 
Sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
Numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy 
No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
Well spent 
Engrossing piece 
Taboo 
Lame and sophomoric 
, my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
A remarkably faithful one 
The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humor went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is 
The cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired 
A superior crime movie 
May rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed 
, a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , 
's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
Whether we 're supposed to shriek 
Gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters 
Showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . 
Charming and quirky 
As in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary 
Every clich�� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera 
Racism and homophobia 
Robbed and replaced 
That best describes this film : honest 
Flexible 
The legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce 
Poetic force and 
As dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects 
Ming-liang 's witty , wistful new film 
Quite tasty and 
I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i do n't see the point . 
's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 
's hardly any fun to watch 
An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
Has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic 
Is visually smart , 
A visually compelling one 
Talky films 
Climax 
Glaring triteness 
Pretty and gifted , it really won my heart 
Like real people 
Be fertile sources of humor 
Has no point and goes nowhere 
The premise of `` abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess 
Best and most unpredictable comedy 
Eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension 
A bad mannered , ugly and destructive little **** 
With little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
, it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance . 
Precious and finely cut diamond 
Take us on his sentimental journey of the heart 
( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense . 
Wide-awake all the way 
It struck a chord in me 
To feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies 
The flawed support structure holding equilibrium up 
Clich��s 
Despite its flaws ... belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
The movie lacks in action 
Alienating 
Be consigned to the dustbin of history 
Saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate 
Settles too easily along the contours of expectation

Merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way 
Its overinflated mythology 
Pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry . 
Narratively complex

Savvy director robert j. siegel and 
Magic and whimsy 
Terrible , banal dialogue ; 
Slow , uneventful

That `` pretty woman '' wanted to be 
This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
Without a glimmer of intelligence or invention 
Leaping from one arresting image to another 
'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls 
Low-budget , video-shot 
From the real-life story to portray themselves in the film

Vivid with color , music and life 
Loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . 
Well-defined 
One of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but ... also one of the most curiously depressing . 
Of no real consequence 
Staggers between flaccid satire and what 
Her material is not first-rate 
Real audience-pleaser 
The humor wry and sprightly 
, lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious 
Forced to follow 
As if ( there 's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something 
Shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . 
Dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
Give what may be the performances of their careers 
Satisfying well-made 
Does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this 
Of quiet power 
Nevertheless efficiently 
It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing 
Does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it . 
Rolling over in their graves 
To the power of the eccentric and the strange 
, washington has a sure hand . 
, this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
Will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
Unreligious 
Too much of storytelling moves away from solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries . 
Bloated plot 
The high standards of performance 
Saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy 
A cool event for the whole family 
The annoyance of that chatty fish 
Accessible and 
A tart , smart breath of fresh air 
Movie star charisma 
Gracefully 
There 's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and 
Who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep 
Atrocious

Grips and holds you in rapt attention from 
Ferocity and thoughtfulness 
Terrible story 
Finely crafted , finely written 
Stylish sizzle 
That perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood 
Pokey 
The rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen 
Of spirit 
A variety of quirky characters and an engaging story 
Is not a bad movie , just mediocre . 
A certain charm 
Tries too hard to be emotional 
Quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ... a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that is n't afraid to admit it does n't have all the answers . 
, it 's quite fun in places . 
Vibrant with originality 
The peak of all things insipid 
The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
Is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well 
Spare wildlife 
Is the cold comfort that chin 's film serves up with style and empathy 
Is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted 
The sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
An hour-and-a-half-long commercial 
Makes one thing abundantly clear . 
Pull us deep into the girls ' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that 's opened between them 
Outstanding originality 
To be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers 
That 's what makes it worth a recommendation 
, non-exploitive approach 
A wonderful tale 
Ages that is n't fake fun 
A fresh view 
Laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh 
It 's sort of in-between , and it works . 
, energetic and original 
The movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , 
Much entertainment value 
Wrong with this ricture 
Elegant entertainment 
Like a wet burlap sack of gloom 
Called `` jar-jar binks : the movie 
Davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
's just as wonderful on the big screen 
Rather dull , unimaginative car chase 
's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
The story has some nice twists but the ending and 
, pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
Often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
Talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it 's still quite worth seeing . 
Bad-movie way 
Outstanding feature debut 
It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
Creative contributions 
Kinda wrong in places 
A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
So larger than life and 
We were soldiers 
To see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles 
In diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack 
Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . 
The artist 's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film 
In execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings 
Find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie 
Of the worst films of the summer 
Super - 
Squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out 
An underachiever , 
, politically charged tapestry 
Treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you 're a struggling nobody 
Screeching-metal 
Savvy , compelling 
Does n't make for great cinema 
A powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
Love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 
, is of overwhelming waste 
A fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , 
Like its hero 
Is funny , scary and sad . 
New adaptation 
, at least terribly monotonous 
Is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating 
Of nonsense 
Taylor 's cartoonish performance 
Performances of ( jack nicholson 's ) career 
Elevate `` glory '' above most of its ilk 
It 's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i 'd say the film works 
It transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest 
To call the film ` refreshing 
Even less capable 
Of torture and self-mutilation 
Intricate , intimate and intelligent 
112-minute 
Is well told 
Has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
If i want music , i 'll buy the soundtrack . 
Worldly knowledge 
Is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics 
Drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 
A smile , just sneers and bile 
And murky cinematography 
Is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time 
Pixar 's 
Makes the experience worthwhile 
That it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
The movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions 
String together enough charming moments to work 
To create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
Be an important movie , or even a good one 
Wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring 
To be a part of that elusive adult world 
As blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis bu?uel film 
Sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play 
Perfect balance 
Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core 
Water torture 
You wo n't care 
Most sincere and artful movie 
Alternately melancholic , hopeful 
Paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor 
Everyone , especially movie musical fans 
The best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes 
Than awe 
Partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- 
Cyndi lauper 
Its contrivances 
It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing . 
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and 
Created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy 
Too-frosty 
A journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 
Gives a superb performance full of deep feeling 
This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and 
Polished and vastly entertaining caper 
Hugely enjoyable 
Negligible work 
She boxes these women 's souls right open for us . 
That any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling 
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else 
Clear and reliable 
Irresistible package 
Gets under our skin and draws us in long 
Sad and rote exercise 
Is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences 
Is extraordinarily good 
An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
Once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
Draw people together 
Derring-do 
Femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . 
Prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences 
Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , 
Have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
What makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest 
Slam-bang extravaganza 
Can see the forest for the trees 
Up as the worst kind of hubristic folly 
Devastating indictment 
This thing is just garbage . 
Makes its point too well 
Bold ( and lovely ) experiment 
Might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants 
The wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough 
Is a little tired 
An off-beat and fanciful film 
Jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , 
Will be friends through thick and thin 
Brought something fresher 
Through the gloomy film noir veil 
The film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing 
From the script 's bad ideas and awkwardness 
The more influential works 
The fun 
Simple and innocent 
Result in a movie that works against itself 
His reserved but existential poignancy 
A sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works 
Bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals 
Stay with the stage versions 
Be me : fighting off the urge to doze 
Simple but absorbing 
In the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers 
This time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part 
Work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose 
With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent 
To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , 
Donovan ... squanders his main asset , 
Would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor . 
Above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings 
A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
See a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' 
Bo derek 
Edward burns ' best film 
Overproduced piece 
Cutting impressions 
Is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
Noble endeavor 
Shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film 
Loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into 
Gangster 
Of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty 
To top form 
That i 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it 
Is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year . 
An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength 
Spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
, it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
This and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole 
The border collie is funny 
Is both convincing and radiant 
With chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
Weighted down 
Where the film ultimately fails 
Intense and effective film 
, indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
Pointed personalities , courage , 
Maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
Embellishment 
It might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy 
Bland hollywood romance 
Intelligent flick 
Strong and unforced 
Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me 
A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness 
, ` how can you charge money for this ? ' 
Thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening 
The substance it so desperately needs 
The wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
Car-wreck 
Could be this good 
An adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle . 
Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
One hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director 
It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
To the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium 
A quirky , off-beat project 
It does n't take itself so deadly seriously 
Impressive fake documentary 
Either 11 times too many or else 
The new star wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
Conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all . 
What makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion . 
E.t. remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg 's misunderstood career . 
By whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes 
Struggled 
Who is too crazy to be interesting 
Seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered 
A naturally funny film , home movie 
No good inside dope , and no particular bite 
A film with a great premise but only a great premise 
Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
Smokers only 
Snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
Watching a walk to remember 
A smart , compelling drama . 
A chilling movie without oppressive 
That 's 86 minutes too long 
The new thriller proves that director m. night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
A paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme 
Sade achieves the near-impossible : 
Is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
Satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood 
About the pitfalls of bad behavior 
Which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
F 
Gorgeously 
Porno flick 
A character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
Rather toothless take 
As an evil , monstrous lunatic 
, inflammatory film 
Cutesy reliance 
A more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease 
In spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic 
Choppy and sloppy affair 
As i 'm the one that i want 
Down to mediocrity 
Crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude 
An uncomfortable experience 
`` ( hopkins ) does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it . 
No solace here , no entertainment value , 
's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project 
Intensely romantic , 
Of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent 
Ever-watchful 
Comes across as lame and sophomoric 
A sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor 
Overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper 
There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
Utter mush ... conceited pap . 
... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned . '' 
Across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length 
And there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene 's story ends . 
Take heart 
Ultimately that 's what makes it worth a recommendation 
Odd , poetic road movie 
... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
To have decades of life as a classic movie franchise 
, very enjoyable ... 
Frustration 
For a barf bag 
He 's the scariest guy you 'll see all summer . 
Doze off thirty minutes 
This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
Concocted 
Warm , inviting , 
The most magical and most fun family fare 
Shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper 
It 's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
Poignant lyricism 
It 's tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too 
Vivid , convincing 
Gives it a buoyant delivery 
Rises ) 
Is n't much to it . 
, violent movie 
Proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep 
Comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
That deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies 
Of dazzling pop entertainment 
Which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
Depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece 
A welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings 
Very sincere work 
Precious little substance in birthday girl 
It 's the sweet cinderella story that `` pretty woman '' wanted to be . 
Short-story quaint 
Big selling point 
, energetic and smart 
The fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theaters for it 
Return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it 's not half-bad . 
It 's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness . 
Loopy 
Love that strikes a very resonant chord 
Ugliness 
A bang-up job 
Fascinating stories 
Will probably be a talky bore . 
Watch if you only had a week to live 
We 're seeing something purer than the real thing 
Lovely , eerie film 
Luckiest stroke 
In the place where a masterpiece should be 
Breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina 
Youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point 
That 's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline 
Guy ritchie 's lock , 
Cracked lunacy 
Is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
Low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard 
's not too bad 
Good human 
Introspective portrait 
Everything that was right about blade 
Most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies 
Enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , 
Profound ethical and philosophical questions 
Just becomes sad 
Well-mounted 
Is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics 
The characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
From unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense 
Lying if i said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of kung pow 
Steven soderbergh 's earlier films 
So much to look 
Violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart 
Seeing things from new sides , 
Ash wednesday is not edward burns ' best film , 
Dumb action movie 
A brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium . 
Good noir 
Plucking tension from quiet 
The most memorable moment 
That it stinks 
Like scorsese 's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot 
Tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge 
Is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love 
-- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- 
A florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull 
This an eminently engrossing film 
Live in denial about 
Purely enjoyable 
Pull a cohesive story out 
Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
In a good way 
Give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise 
This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
Take the grandkids or the grandparents 
Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
Sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure 
Difficult 
Is generally amusing from time to time 
One of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time 
Leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing 
Like whether compromise is the death of self ... this orgasm ( wo n't be an ) exceedingly memorable one for most people 
Would leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered 
Presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson 
Murderous 
Generates little narrative momentum , and 
A smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas 
Is one of mr. chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
Actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
Between passion and pretence 
A moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer 
Misfiring 
... might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
Zzzzzzzzz 
Smart and 
The piece works 
To be interesting 
Excellence 
A bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
A refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale 
Genuine 
Have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor 
Of smart jokes 
Directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
To be more complex than your average film 
The film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks 
A bad blend of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story 
Welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
The movie 's seams may show ... but pellington gives `` mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
Enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . 
By laurice guillen 
Tiny acts of kindness 
The movie has no idea of it is serious 
Often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast 
Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
Is truly funny 
Silly overkill 
This charmer has a spirit that can not be denied 
An inept , tedious spoof 
It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
It 's just a kids ' flick 
The film has a kind of hard , cold effect . 
Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but 
I killed my father 
... ` the country bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
Is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess 
So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic . 
Cultivated 
Delicate balance 
Stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time 
Incessant use 
The most original 
Candid , archly funny and 
, while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing 
What a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this 
For a movie that tries to be smart 
Maybe twice 
Likely to induce sleep than fright 
Social injustice 
Any 
Is as often imaginative 
Flick cliches 
More revealing , more emotional and 
An action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep 
The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . ' 
Of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity 
Something hip 
Phenomenal , 
The story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . 
Is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and 
Incredible imax sound system 
The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing 
Dim-witted 
You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz 
I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't . 
Acted by a british cast to rival gosford park 's . 
A delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction 
Starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
Would have a hard time sitting through this one 
Serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history 
To kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering 
Fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic 
The film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown 's life . 
Big letdown 
The images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction 
Special fishy community 
Sour , bloody and mean 
's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . 
Is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential 
Soon-to-be-forgettable '' section 
What enlivens this film 
Is , as comedy goes , 
Is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
Is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes 
An erratic career 
Wasted . 
Most purely enjoyable and 
It 's a pale imitation . 
... one of the more influential works of the ` korean new wave ' . 
Fascinating look 
, this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs. robinson complex 
On action 
Dramatic and emotional pull 
Should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 '' at the end of its title . 
Helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games 
Real characters and compelling plots 
Truly funny 
A bilingual charmer , 
Of the most exciting action films 
Offers little insight 
As both shallow and dim-witted 
Lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
Imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
Dazzling 
A better film 
Ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut 
He fails . 
Sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser 
Any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster 
The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
Fly with most intelligent viewers 
Fly at such a furiously funny pace 
Ai n't art , 
Wit and compassion 
It 's also cold , gray , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated . 
Completely awful iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque 
A cinematic car wreck , 
Nothing but net 
A sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
You second-guess your affection for the original 
Was followed by the bad idea 
Is a film living far too much in its own head . 
An unforced , rapid-fire delivery 
Is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions 
A movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' 
` amateur ' in almost every frame 
Is filled with strange and wonderful creatures 
The film has a lot of charm . 
Quirky iranian drama secret ballot 
Punch and depth 
Arrive early and stay late , 
So tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian 
That it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults 
Of love and destiny 
Is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel 
Yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , 
Eminently engrossing film 
, i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) . 
Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
It also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults 
A cutesy romantic tale with a twist . 
, crossroads comes up shorter than britney 's cutoffs . 
Its faults 
Rollicking good time 
The most inventive 
A surprisingly sensitive script co-written 
It is n't scary . 
Have a radar for juicy roles 
Hated myself 
, low-budget constraints 
Passion and energy 
Its courage , ideas , technical proficiency 
Is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution 
Inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
It 's more enjoyable than i expected , though 
Disquieting 
A distinguished film legacy 
Of being boring 
I usually dread encountering the most 
's the very definition of epic adventure . 
Somber pacing and lack 
Has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock 
To either effort in three hours of screen time 
( the kid 's ) just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow 
The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time

A handful 
A chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department .

The shameless self-caricature 
Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . 
In formal settings with motionless characters 
As both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
Bogs down in insignificance

Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
A passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action . 
Hipness 
While ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads 
Delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower 
Is completely lacking in charm and charisma ,

The story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
It explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
Meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot 
Has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
Because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; 
Add up to more than body count 
Carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
Just ca n't take it any more

Noteworthy characters 
To reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
A fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old `` twilight zone '' episode 
Absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man 
Fans of plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but 
A part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something 
That spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot 
Canny , meditative 
The picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is . 
But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort 
A movie that will make you laugh 
Interesting characters 
As the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . 
Overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm .

You are wet in some places 
Hell-jaunt 
Allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- 
Conceptually brilliant ... plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown .

Achieves its main strategic objective 
Delicately performed 
Plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
Racist 
Want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters 
Insanely funny 
Has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
A much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation 
The lines work 
Nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself 
Quite able 
's not only dull 
A crowd-pleaser 
Nary a glimmer of self-knowledge 
-- even more damning -- 
Far more stylish 
Dedicated 
Full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
Shines 
A psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian ... 
That tries too hard to be emotional 
What a reckless squandering of four fine 
Rollicking dark humor 
The actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , 
And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are . 
The movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
Truly wonderful tale 
Some cute moments 
Pack raw dough in my ears 
An unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera 
Heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign 
It looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . ' 
Just goes on and on and on and on 
The playful paranoia of the film 's past 
Shot two years ago 
Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .

There 's much to recommend the film . 
A minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera

Changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it 's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
Celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light . 
A cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence 
There was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout

Putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film 
Change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
Ends up falling short as a whole 
Like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
Would have a good time here . 
Doze off for a few minutes or

Unlikable characters

Red dragon '' is entertaining . 
A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
Terrific performance 
Shows excess in business and pleasure 
That hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking 
This summer that do not involve a dentist drill

Tank 
The movie knew what to do with him 
You do n't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that 's the mark of a documentary that works 
Like nothing we westerners have seen before 
( ramsay ) visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
A charming , funny and beautifully crafted import 
Romantic , riveting and handsomely 
Sensual delights and simmering violence 
It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but 
We get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and meat loaf explodes . 
Charm and charisma 
See an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade 
Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .

Where bergman approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson 's far side humor 
Adams just copies from various sources 
An interesting slice of history . 
Add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments 
Is too much of a plunge 
Of our making 
Excels 
Makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything 
Fast-paced and wonderfully edited 
The biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john 
The most compelling performance of the year 
The best actors there is 
Twice as bestial but half as funny 
There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . 
A phlegmatic bore , 
The ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul 
's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images 
Self-discovery handled with such sensitivity 
Will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible 
Not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing 
Intimate and panoramic 
Of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor 
In unexpected ways , touching 
First-rate performances 
Cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and 
Anguished 
Make for a bad film 
To the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories 
Is truth 
Shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable 
In a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
Unfocused and tediously exasperating 
Genuine excitement 
On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
Will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche 
They succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . 
A total washout 
Summer fluff 
Unmistakable , easy 
A clear-eyed 
The conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters 
As ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j. barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous 
Entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's 
Manages to escape the shackles of its own clich��s to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
Attributable to a movie like this 
Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect 
Craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
Presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale 
Hard-driving narcissism is a given 
Being surprisingly dull 
In a fat man 's navel 
Rejected must have been astronomically bad 
A simple `` goddammit 
Thornier 
While most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that 's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 
Film buffs will eat up like so much gelati 
Claustrophobic 
With tremendous skill 
Blazingly alive and admirable on many levels 
Of cinema 's directorial giants 
Drags during its 112-minute length 
Enthralling aesthetic experience 
Gets the tone just right 
Turns out to be ( assayas ' ) homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness 
Fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless 
Paper-thin and 
Can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good 
No real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same 
The next a turgid drama 
Is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world 
Proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
Negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship 
This is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
Malcolm mcdowell is cool . 
Ice cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin 
Suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man 
In all the best possible ways 
, i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
Smart , romantic drama 
, you 're on the edge of your seat 
Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
To the illogic of its characters 
A low-budget series 
's not trying to laugh at how bad 
Has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama 
Has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense 
Long and relentlessly saccharine 
References to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit 
Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast 
Lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this 
Sensual and funny 
Written , flatly 
She 's not funny 
Terrific special effects 
Is one of the year 's best . 
If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
Made , on all levels , 
As ill-fitting as shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops 
Enthusiastic charm 
Be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . 
Glancing vividly back 
That one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness 
Remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt 
Is a horrible movie 
Clever and suspenseful 
A three-hour cinema master class . 
The film 's desire to be liked sometimes 
A smartly written motion picture 
Their outrageousness 
Is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half 
Relies less on forced air than on petter n?ss ' delicate , clever direction ... and a wonderful , imaginative script 
A creepy and dead-on performance 
Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
You missed the point 
Has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud ... and parmentier . 
Give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy 
Has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness 
Deceptions 
Proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny 
But a little too smugly 
Most flamboyant female comics 
The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and 
The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry 
A fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich��s and showcases a group of dedicated artists 
Believe that resident evil is not it 
Well-crafted family film 
Thrill 
Awesome 
Piercing domestic drama 
Go back and choose to skip it 
Run-of-the-mill profanity 
Bittersweet 
Mediocre movie 
All over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own 
The movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
Solid and refined piece 
It 's not too fast and not too slow . 
With an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
's self-defeatingly decorous 
But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
A sour taste in one 's mouth , 
High-profile name 
Of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
The little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
This date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts 
It is also beautifully acted . 
Sprightly spin 
Maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul 
College 
From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
Of the most genuinely sweet films 
The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... ( it ) comes off like a hallmark commercial 
Obnoxious 88-minute 
Is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film 
The fat 
Is disappointing 
Footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire 
Plainly dull and visually ugly 
Another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults 
, this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
The movie sinks into an abyss of clich��s , depression and bad alternative music . 
It 's a spectacular performance - ahem 
Presents a frightening and compelling ` what if 
Even predictable remake 
Puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula 
We value in our daily lives 
As an actor 's showcase , hart 's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . 
Is distressingly rote 
Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics 
None of this is meaningful or memorable , but 
All that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain 
With humor 
A sobering and powerful documentary 
Casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , 
, amusing study 
Technical triumph 
Gluing you to the edge of your seat 
Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers 
You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
Who deserve but rarely receive it 
Most aggressive and most sincere 
Be used to burn every print of the film 
Takes too long to shake 
Like a prison stretch 
It 's self-defeatingly decorous 
A fanciful drama about napoleon 's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility 
Its own direction 
Exciting documentary 
Their own cleverness 
If you 're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver 's license 
Is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice 
A college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing ! 
Neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief 
For proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
It 's not really funny 
Savagely 
That storytelling has value can not be denied . 
Is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad . 
Indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest 
Concentration 
Tendency to slip into hokum 
Is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
Admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and 
Funny , and even touching 
To go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum 
Find an escape clause 
Spout hilarious dialogue 
Disturbing disregard 
In the arguments of competing lawyers 
Of that moral favorite 
By folks worthy of scorn 
Achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence 
Confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
A failure of storytelling 
Jackass is a vulgar and 
Drama that takes itself all too seriously 
Is extraordinary 
, but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera 
Some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
Dislikable 
Voyeuristic spectacle 
As predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , 
Updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place 
On digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb 
Nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - 
Pretty funny 
Striking style 
Contains no wit , only labored gags . 
Bogged down over 140 minutes 
Fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency 
Gently funny , sweetly adventurous 
A majestic achievement , 
Star-studded 
Undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama 
To be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors 
... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
A cut above the rest 
That interweaves individual stories 
Sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it 
Old porridge 
As an eloquent memorial 
Familiar and predictable , 
Iconic hero 
A big splash 
A movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made 
A joy 
Articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy . 
Understands characters must come first 
It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
Is its reliance on formula 
It feels much longer 
Marvelous documentary touches 
, sweaty-palmed fun 
Freddy gets molested by a dog 
Sadly , ` garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` wayne . ' 
What kind of sewage 
Can see coming a mile away 
The script by vincent r. nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
Lots of hollywood fluff 
Awful snooze . 
Sentimentalized 
An astonishing voice cast 
Popular gulzar and jagjit singh 
A heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie 
An ambitious movie 
Witty 
Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy 
Prozac nation 
Dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . 
, ` santa clause 2 ' is wondrously creative . 
A fine effort 
The triumph of his band 
Mediocre end 
Is amateurish 
The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does n't have big screen magic 
's too close to real life to make sense 
Feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
Illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's hollywood 
At heart is a sweet little girl 
Tainted 
Tired stereotypes 
Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
Tragic waste 
After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
A deft pace master and stylist 
Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
They do n't fit well together 
Does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen 
Moulin rouge 
Colorful , dramatized pbs program 
're far better served by the source material 
Of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome 
Authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
The intended , er , spirit 
As well-conceived as either of those films 
A sharp script and 
Have a fun , no-frills ride 
Deep-seated , emotional need 
Personified in the film 's simple title 
Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses 
Good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it 
Condescending stereotypes 
Is amazing , yes 
It has a genuine dramatic impact 
`` sorority boys '' was funnier , 
Its sweet time 
Thoughtfulness 
Watch people 
As the chatter of parrots raised on oprah 
Visual clarity and deeply 
A loud , low-budget and tired formula film 
Video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all 
Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
Honest , sensitive story 
( t ) he ideas of revolution # 9 are more compelling than the execution 
He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
A halfway intriguing plot 
Klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
2002 's first great film 
Its paint fights , motorized scooter chases 
Do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
Little action , almost 
It 's probably not accurate to call it a movie 
To believe in it the most 
The full monty , but a really strong second effort 
Has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
Clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes 
Too stagey 
Requiring a great deal of thought 
Enduring strengths 
Offers a desperately ingratiating performance 
Tired , unimaginative and derivative 
Is a more fascinating look at the future than `` bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
Stale 
An undeniably moving film to experience , and 
Its whimsical humor 
Its good qualities 
One but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms 
Jaw-droppingly beautiful work 
There are laughs aplenty , 
Funny and well-contructed black comedy 
Grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made 
Will be well worth your time 
Seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times . 
Same old story 
Is solid , satisfying fare for adults 
Shallow styles 
Efficiency and 
Set up 
As an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . 
Ends up sounding like satire 
, the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity . 
( soderbergh ) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and 
Seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense 
Begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject 
Are great rewards here 
Terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating 
The touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible 
Slapstick sequences 
Suitably elegant 
The most moronic screenplays 
I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me 
A splash 
Is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes 
Comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
Sitting in a downtown caf�� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , 
, at times sublime , visuals 
A.c. will help this movie one bit 
Be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker 
Disquietingly 
Abstract approach 
A sleek advert 
Variable 
Has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper 
Muddy psychological 
A film that comes along every day . 
This film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
Thoughtlessly assembled 
Edward burns ' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde 
Though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab 
( carvey 's ) characters are both overplayed and exaggerated 
It 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something 
Cheap clich�� 
Slopped ` 
Faint of heart or conservative of spirit 
The upbeat ending 
Makes each crumb of emotional comfort 
A pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent 
Of the lightweight female empowerment 
That 's as crisp and to the point 
Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this . 
Writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
Can take the grandkids or the grandparents and 
Addition to being very funny 
A touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism 
To hit all of its marks 
One of the year 's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
Of purpose or even a plot 
Olivier assayas ' elegantly appointed period drama 
Do all three quite well 
Seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
To suffer ' 
Made tucker a star 
's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess 
Adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say 
Children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and 
Is workmanlike in the extreme 
An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship 
Of his sweetness and vulnerability 
Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora 's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
Humanly possible 
Is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
The off-center humor 
Overtly silly dialogue 
The pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy 
Happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares 
Amiable but 
Terribly funny 
A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy 
Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence 
A colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters 
Bad writing , 
Maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in 
An invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker 's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent 
With humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life 
To make their way through this tragedy 
Directs , ideally 
A movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
Just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
Leave them singing long after the credits roll 
Have decades of life as a classic movie franchise 
The journey does n't really go anywhere . 
'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
Of ridiculousness 
A milquetoast movie 
, it 's a work of enthralling drama 
Is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
So believable that you feel what they feel 
Is difficult to fathom . 
A road-trip drama 
Best date movie 
Flat and 
Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment 
Full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing . 
Bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
Into an intense and engrossing head-trip 
( clooney 's ) debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but 
Camaraderie 
By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
Film that loses sight of its own story 
A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact . 
Moore wonderfully 
Crafty , energetic and smart 
Run for your lives 
Truly terrible . 
Sweetness , clarity and emotional 
Severe flaws 
Get on television 
Adorably ditsy but 
Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
Seriously dumb 
Ear-pleasing songs 
Old garbage 
, bad , bad movie 
Love liza 's 
, can prevent its tragic waste of life 
It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and 
Searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful 
's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
Romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here 
Suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
Uniformly good 
Solidly entertaining and moving 
Have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
A plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project ! 
Takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative 
Green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
Austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
The multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion 
Visual poetry 
Still seems timely and important . 
There 's lots of cool stuff packed into espn 's ultimate x. 
Is impressively true for being so hot-blooded 
While not for every taste 
Eloquent ( meditation ) on death and that most elusive of passions 
Weepy melodrama 
Flimsy flicks 
's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
The screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him 
Special walk 
That shows the promise of digital filmmaking 
Suited 
Fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context 
In auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
, tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage 
Kapur modernizes a.e.w. mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks `` the four feathers '' bare . 
Consistently intelligent 
Classy 
Did n't particularly like e.t. the first time i saw it as a young boy 
Evocative imagery 
Would be a total washout . 
Shakes you vigorously for its duration 
's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science 
A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . 
Beg the question ` why 
Brings the proper conviction to his role as ( jason bourne ) 
Twisted shapes history 
This refreshing visit 
Lurid and less than lucid work . 
The movie looks genuinely pretty . 
Fine music never heard 
Denzel 
Visually compelling one 
Relentlessly downbeat 
A sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects 
Director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times . 
Bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary 
Attraction 
, eloquent film 
, his little changes ring hollow 
A special kind of movie 
A fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it 
Terrific look 
To his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen 
The retro gang melodrama 
Sentimentalizing it 
Overcooked souffl�� 
Not-so-funny 
Still shines in her quiet blue eyes 
What makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine 's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
Portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue 
'' overcome its weaknesses 
Each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture 
Stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
Fit well together 
A tidal wave of plot 
That this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful 
To ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky 
It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's reign of fire . 
Would have made vittorio de sica proud 
A searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise . 
Dumb story 
The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and 
That would have made vittorio de sica proud 
Me without you has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 
That actually manages to bring something new into the mix 
Provocative central wedding sequence 
Where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony 
A moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke 
Sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean ` dramedy ' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
The earnest emotional core 
Amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise 
Retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash 
Have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors 
Plastered with one hollywood cliche 
-- and far less crass 
For all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie . 
, the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
Weird little movie 
Poo-poo jokes 
America 's thirst 
Emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the ( teen comedy ) genre a bad name . 
A thinking man 's 
The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
Breathtakingly assured and stylish 
Is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack 
Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they ca n't go wrong . 
I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious 
Of ( witherspoon 's ) better films 
Revelatory 
An average b-movie 
Confined 
Sinks further and further 
Poetic , heartbreaking 
Is funny , insightfully human 
A playful respite 
Us to forget most of the film 's problems 
Bad company . 
Layered , well-developed characters and some surprises 
Pointed personalities , courage , tragedy 
Any less psycho 
Runs on the pure adrenalin 
, peculiar and always entertaining costume drama 
, you 're a jet all the way 
Worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production 
Is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) 
Film that will enthrall the whole family 
Too stagy 
We 've liked klein 's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root 
The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots 
A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film 
Could n't really figure out how to flesh either out 
Fairly predictable psychological thriller 
Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
Especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english 
Teeth-gnashing actorliness 
An impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow 
High art 
One of them 
Telling a fascinating character 's story 
Anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket 
Too heavy for the plot 
For reverence and a little wit 
Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
Fun , 
An uneasy mix 
If it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
Drawn engaging characters 
Most good-hearted yet sensual 
A decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
Are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , 
Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting . 
The film is not only a love song to the movies 
Just a string of stale gags 
This film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
Is little else 
Because ( the leads ) are such a companionable couple 
Lacks the utter authority of a genre gem 
, this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
, it already has one strike against it . 
Where a masterpiece should be 
'll like it 
Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke 
Liked by the people who can still give him work 
Exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza 
The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but 
Jet 
With its own cuteness 
Chasing who 
Engaging mix 
Take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead 
's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast 
But because of the startling intimacy 
Are acting horribly 
The way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
Mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
At 2002 's sundance festival 
A way that verges on the amateurish 
Strikes a potent chemistry 
Old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . 
Buy is an accomplished actress , 
Hugely entertaining and uplifting 
Certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
Intensely lived 
Is bad 
About this love story 
Me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes 
Dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography 
Exuberant 
May have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not 
Impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
Is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
Heated sexuality 
Reinvigorated 
... watching it was painful . 
Evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn . 
` unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . 
World trade center tragedy 
Refreshingly smart and newfangled variation 
Constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
Plod 
A riveting documentary . 
, featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
Personal velocity 
Went 8 movies ago 
Are an immensely appealing couple 
Discover that tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus 
It promised it would be 
Are incredibly captivating and insanely funny 
Is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless 
Too mushy 
Dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater 
's just rather leaden and dull . 
All as very important 
The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . 
Of what it actually means to face your fears 
The ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and 
Is vivacious 
Von sydow ... is itself intacto 's luckiest stroke 
Lumbering , wheezy 
You feel like a sucker 
Is n't one true ` chan moment ' 
Delivers without sham the raw-nerved story . 
Routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny 
Florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama 
A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
The story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling 
Charismatic 
Clumsiness 
An amazing breakthrough 
Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
There 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , 
It actually improves upon the original hit movie 
Smart , provocative drama 
, common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
Tremendous 
Parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville 's plotline , they 
Could restage the whole thing in your bathtub 
A low-budget affair , tadpole 
Do anything 
Make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime 
Funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy 
Bias 
Is hartley 's least accessible screed 
Conrad l. hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year 
's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones 's diary 
Slightly less successful than the first 
Moving performance 
A great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige 
There are n't many conclusive answers in the film , 
It 's a work of enthralling drama 
Meets his future wife 
, we do n't get williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
Instantly forgettable 
Unsatisfying 
A glorified episode 
's a lousy one at that . 
Unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
Wars 
Honestly nice little film 
The humor and humanity 
Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness 
Because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving 
Are neither original 
Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema . 
A polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con . 
Life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad 
His intellectual rigor 
Honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film 
Dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue 
A disney pic 
, crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
Undeniably moving 
Into a lyrical and celebratory vision 
Walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost . 
Does n't live up to material 
Is rather choppy 
Of the movie 's success 
The astonishingly pivotal role 
That fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people 
The average white band 's `` pick up the pieces 
Grow boring ... 
Invites unflattering comparisons 
The right conditions 
Brisk , reverent , and subtly different 
Shakes you vigorously 
Proves it 's never too late to learn 
Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
Oddly moving 
A lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy 
That breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people 
Mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either . 
, imagination and insight 
The edge of your seat 
It 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
Jack o ' 
Naturalistic acting 
's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . 
By john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war 
Sex with strangers is a success . 
, director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers 
Compassion , sacrifice , and christian love 
They are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
Permits laughter 
, standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages . 
It 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective . 
By now intolerable 
Although made on a shoestring and unevenly 
With steven seagal 
Is consistently amusing and engrossing ... 
You feel good , you feel sad , 
Is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts 
( sports ) admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
Captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better 
, credible 
The picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival 
This waste of time 
That it can not even be dubbed hedonistic 
Conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects 
A stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire 
Wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way 
Cheap , b movie way 
I was entranced . 
A copy of a copy of a copy 
Mesmerizing 
Pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars 
Realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and 
Transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil 
Mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies 
For fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster 
A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
Is enjoyable family fare 
, instantly disposable 
An almost sure-fire prescription 
Sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
One oscar nomination for julianne moore this year 
Smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise 
A good shot 
Redundant , sloppy 
Do n't even like their characters 
Little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors 
Will wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned . '' 
Others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches 
Good things happen to bad people 
If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
No one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , 
Lifeless rumblings 
Major problem 
Not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
Is analytical 
Works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm 
Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting 
Is warm , inviting , and surprising 
A fine idea 
The charm of the first movie is still there , and 
Vanity project 
's very beavis and butthead , yet always 
A vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that 
Warm your heart 
, no-frills ride 
, unmemorable filler . 
The proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters 
Emotional intelligence 
Fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies 
Visceral and spiritual 
He 's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
, this dumas adaptation entertains 
The man 
There 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics ) 
Confessions is n't always coherent , 
Flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he 's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
But it was n't . 
Crummy-looking videotape 
This is downright movie penance 
The slow , lingering death of imagination 
Director douglas mcgrath 
Of a first-rate cast 
Nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
All the outward elements of the original 
Of riveting set pieces 
A very valuable film 
Openness , the little surprises 
Is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew 
, it 's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship . 
No thanks . 
This comic slugfest 
A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them 
, uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery 
Is lacking 
Buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free 
, the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
A lot of talent 
Problematic 
What 's even more remarkable 
Has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
Authenticate 
Should share screenwriting credit 
Chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact 
The fun 
, hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
Feel fresh 
The off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery 
It 's his strongest performance since the doors 
's a great performance and a reminder of dickens ' grandeur . 
Embraces it , energizes it 
Del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
Without reeking of research library dust 
A much needed kick , making `` die another day '' one of the most entertaining bonds in years 
Fling gags at it 
Stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying 
It does give exposure to some talented performers 
's never dull and 
Only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them 
Gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
Michael moore 's latest documentary about america 's thirst for violence is his best film yet ... 
Unfunny tricks 
Stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline 
Cruel , misanthropic stuff 
Bland police procedural details , fiennes 
Succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
That it 's offensive , but that it 's boring 
Control-alt-delete simone 
's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message 
With one of france 's most inventive directors 
Character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her 
The accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form 
Terrible 
The cultural distinctions 
Tiresome jargon 
Even more predictable , cliche-ridden 
Unrelentingly grim -- 
Heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart 
A fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich��s and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
Rock 's stand-up magic 
Fear and paranoia 
High-adrenaline documentary 
Above anything sandler 
There 's not nearly enough that 's right 
Is a riveting , brisk delight 
The movie is all portent and no content 
Creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images 
Ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans 
Incurably romantic 
Vibrance 
Take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
Remarkable yet 
I have given this movie a rating of zero . 
Well-thought stunts 
But certainly hard to hate 
A wry , affectionate delight 
Scores a direct hit . 
Is n't downright silly 
Every moment crackles with tension , and 
Wildlife 
Is careless and unfocused . 
A bit exploitative 
Welled up in my eyes both times 
Inspires more 
Fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian 
The leads ) are such a companionable couple 
Gutter romancer 's 
This is a more fascinating look at the future than `` bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
Of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being 
Shrewd 
A journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship 
Heart-felt 
Make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal 
Peculiar and always entertaining costume drama 
Shamelessly enjoyed it 
The most part a useless movie 
Crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
Thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
The best film of the year 2002 
Ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh 
The material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
To be taken seriously 
This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one 
A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
An ingenious and often harrowing 
Shabby digital photography 
A pretty good execution 
Rerun 
, wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 
Of the most affecting depictions of a love affair 
Is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche 
A technical triumph and 
The middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
Unpleasant 
's an excellent 90-minute film here 
Ambitious 
Fun and nimble 
Allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper 
Purposefully 
The filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
Cheesier to cheesiest 
Muddled 
Tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists 
An ambitious ` what if ? ' 
Enjoying himself immensely 
Will be two hours gained 
Bore most audiences 
A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick 
A crisp psychological drama ( and ) a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old `` twilight zone '' episode 
Feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams 
A few good laughs 
Is more fully 
The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
Takes its central idea way too seriously 
Annoying and 
You 'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment 
Would require many sessions on the couch of dr. freud . 
Sweet-tempered 
That underlies the best of comedies 
Fairly harmless 
No big whoop 
Arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation 
An old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed 
Solid performances and 
Occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold 
To the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction 
Mature and frank fashion 
Dopey old 
Craven 
Explicit 
Subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film 
Most horrific 
Most immediate and most obvious 
Gaunt 
Be a bit of a cheat in the end 
Aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats 
Something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life 
With enough unexpected twists 
That rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time 
A movie that understands characters must come first 
Being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe 
Weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past 
How good 
Philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing 
Also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were . 
As it should be 
Of fighting hard for something that really matters 
Amiable 
Unfulfilling 
Is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america 
Plays closer to two . 
Direct-to-video stuff 
, e.t. is still a cinematic touchstone . 
Funny , 
A can of 2-day old coke 
Charge money for this ? 
Feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group ... and never fails to entertain 
Over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense 
Assayas ' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne 
Through this picture i was beginning to hate it 
So many red herrings , 
Be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work 
Technical flaws to get in the way 
The triviality 
Articulates 
Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust . 
The superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art 
Substantive movie 
Is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
Is so pat it makes your teeth hurt 
Sensual 
That pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose 
Wildly inventive mixture 
Delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy 
An uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
Is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions 
Uncompromising knowledge 
For perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment 
Completely delightful 
The teeny-bopper set 
Wish had been developed with more care 
Of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself 
Of animal house 
Payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . 
Of american pie hijinks 
A terrific screenplay and 
The film 's creepy 
An off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that 
's better than the phantom menace 
... instead go rent `` shakes the clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
An angel simplicity 
An odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
Look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar 
Takes hold and grips 
Sad but endearing characters 
Outrageous or funny 
It seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation 
, it irrigates our souls . 
The ridiculousness of its premise 
A smart , funny look 
Flakeball 
, introspective and entertaining 
The best of godard 's movies 
No amount of good acting 
Nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
`` cremaster 3 '' should come with the warning `` for serious film buffs only ! '' 
More strongly 
The believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
Though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
Horrible pains 
Been there , done that , 
Laughable 
Seems a bit on the skinny side 
The story ... is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . 
Neatly 
Same love story 
I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
The cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and 
I have n't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
Works - 
's coherent , well shot , 
Guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) . 
's already a joke in the united states . 
A heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic 
-- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- 
Like the original 
Of the ya-ya sisterhood 
Give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour 
Unimaginative 
A dramatic comedy as pleasantly 
To a superior crime movie 
In an increasingly important film industry and 
's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous 
The likes 
Without resorting to camp or parody 
Terrific special effects and 
Improved upon the first and 
Has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity 
An overly-familiar set 
This wafer-thin movie 
This film speaks for itself 
About a domestic unit finding their way to joy 
Sublime music 
Should never have been brought out of hibernation 
It never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's . 
A genuine love story , 
Will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other 
Avarice and damaged dreams 
Devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants 
The comedy equivalent of saddam hussein 
Dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem 
An overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story 
It 's still damn funny stuff 
Distanced us 
A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
The performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye 
Er , bubbly 
Of candid camera 
` opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down . 
Mr. spielberg 's 1993 classic 
Was a guilty pleasure 
This sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us 
You come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated . 
, but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining . 
Stand as intellectual masterpieces 
A superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing 
Relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... 
Its screwed-up characters 
-- thoughtfully written 
Though the story ... is hackneyed 
Seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material 
( headbanger ) 
Fun and 
Lively songs for deft punctuation 
Are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence 
Well-put-together piece 
Boring talking heads , 
, `` rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j. 
This is n't a stand up and cheer flick ; it 's a sit down and ponder affair . 
Provides an invaluable service 
Hackneyed elements 
Help sustain it 
Plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown . 
On-screen chemistry 
By director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap 
Created a brilliant motion picture 
, miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
With serious ideas 
I suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care 
Means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
Seems embarrassed by his own invention 
A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
This familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it 's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times . 
Inspiring or insightful 
Did n't hollywood think of this sooner 
A lot more bluster than bite 
Attempts , in vain

Great visual stylists

Was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second 
Unblinkingly pure 
Another disjointed 
It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but 
Go down with a ship as leaky as this 
In a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness 
Dedication 
That perverse element 
Is on full , irritating display in ( this ) meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
Frustrations 
A journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it 's potentially just as rewarding . 
Down over 140 minutes

Dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate 
A little fleeing of its own

A fine production

Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
( a ) mess . 
At times , it actually hurts to watch . 
Is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
Important director 
Between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial 
Displays impeccable comic skill 
Barry 's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile 
Sharp comic timing 
A delightful romantic comedy with plenty 
Is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it 's more than a worthwhile effort . 
New

Two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress 
Excellent 90-minute film 
An interesting look 
Out-to-change-the-world 
Drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice 
Too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots 
Quiet , introspective and entertaining independent 
Whole hours 
Another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
Darkly funny and 
Together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire 
Aan opportunity wasted . 
Sweeping 
Pulp melodrama 
That is the central flaw of the film 
Finally has failed him . 
Much worth 
Keep them guessing 
A promise nor 
An out of place metaphor 
Should see it as soon as possible . 
Created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores 
His art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival 
Is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
's the worst movie of 2002 
Forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be 
I thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny 
I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .

The way to striking a blow for artistic integrity 
Hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor 
Zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
A student film 
Holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized 
Is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults 
Fairly ludicrous 
Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ... 
Does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
Weighs down the tale with bogus profundities 
The ethereal beauty 
Surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches 
Directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
Pulpy concept

Of awe 
Aimless for much of its running time

Grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback 's heidegger - and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
Holes and completely lacking in chills 
Absurdities 
The talent is undeniable

Does n't really know or care about the characters , 
The heart-pounding suspense 
An enjoyably frothy ` date movie ' ... 
An ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , 
Is that it 's also one of the smartest 
Felt fantasy of a director 's travel 
An edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era . 
's where the film ultimately fails 
Is the ultimate movie experience 
An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
Is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
Street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence 
Saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay 
Silly fluff 
This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker 
A few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . 
Viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality 
On a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society ...

A surprisingly faithful remake 
Refreshing 
That slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth 
Should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad

Realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen 
Forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about 
A solid cast , 
Its material that is deliberately unsettling 
If the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is ( cattaneo ) sophomore slump .

Movie fun 
How important our special talents can be when put in service of of others 
The overuse of special effects 
Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .

The best ensemble casts 
Superior horror flick 
Perhaps the best sports movie i 've ever seen . 
A high enough level of invention 
A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow 's car . 
Wreck 
Unsettling subject matter 
Have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out `` when you 're a jet 
A pandora 's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
A single iota worse 
A zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy 
A must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 
One decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue 
Arduous journey

And there 's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti

Providing some good old fashioned spooks 
Rather unfocused 
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' 
Strains 
It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline 
Hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source 's complexity 
You 've completely lowered your entertainment standards 
, the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
In good measure 
Angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
Captive by mediocrity . 
Be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael 
As glum as mr. de niro 
Crane 's decline 
Has since 
Full of charm 
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and 
Knows how to tell us about people . 
The characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , 
Raimi and his team could n't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen . 
Another genre exercise 
That george lucas can only dream of 
Aftertaste 
A reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
To be delightfully compatible here 
Sure , it 's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be . 
I 'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls 
How lame 
, the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time . 
To know your ice-t 's from your cool-j 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california 
A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at 
A picture-perfect beach 
Accuracy

A delightful entree 
Brainless , but 
A wild , endearing , masterful documentary . 
Sometimes improbable 
Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda 
Been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn 
Handsome and well-made entertainment 
Well-executed spy-thriller . 
It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received . 
A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 
Does n't generate a lot of energy . 
, frenetic , funny , even punny 6 
See it for his performance if nothing else 
An action film that delivers on the promise of excitement 
The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
A serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out 
Charming , funny and beautifully 
A bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet 
Action-packed 
New benchmark 
Evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s

Enormous packages 
A work of art 
Been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted 
Despite juliet stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela 's emotional roller coaster life 
An inconsequential 
Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
's also not very good . 
Fine , nuanced lead performances 
Despite the surface attractions 
A compelling motion 
Worse , routine 
... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made . 
The gay '70s 
, in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is 
Watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
Sacrificed for the sake of spectacle 
To be a monster movie for the art-house crowd 
Its surprises 
Looked like crap 
Of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel 
You expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest 
With a series of riveting set pieces 
Tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy 
Cliches , painful improbability and 
Could have turned this into an argentine retread of `` iris '' or `` american beauty , 
Guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts 
Be lovely 
Good time 
, by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails 
Perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic 
Is dudsville . 
Is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
So easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks 
Laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances 
Illuminates 
The most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug 
Both contrived and cliched 
Can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities

Constricted 
Too-conscientious adaptation 
Is just the ticket you need . 
The empty theaters 
Irony 
Will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious 
It wants to be 
Under-10 set 
A loud , ugly , irritating movie 
Informative 
To long for the end credits 
Clumsy 
Looking for a return ticket

Stylized swedish fillm 
The queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby 
Inspiring and pure 
Is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
It 's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
Functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
Amateurish screenplay 
Of the intelligent , well-made b movie 
Wo n't stand the cold light of day 
It gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , 
Dazzle and delight us 
Most complex , generous and subversive artworks 
Its crack cast 
Works better the less the brain is engaged 
Wondering about the characters ' lives after the clever credits roll 
Ultimately flawed 
A moving experience for people who have n't read the book 
Appropriately cynical social commentary 
The connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
Alfred hitchcock 's 
The production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , 
Sucks . '

One of the worst films of 2002 . 
Eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes

A rumor of angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness 
White 's dry wit 
A perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- 
Is , more often then 
A whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting 
, a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
On this screenplay 
Ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance .

A time machine , a journey back to your childhood 
Yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective 
The recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- 
Exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken 
The trees hooting it 's praises

Unholy mess

Patchy combination 
Emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen 
Is just lazy writing . 
Business plans 
He refuses to give us real situations and characters 
Of telling a fascinating character 's story 
Is simple but absorbing . 
Stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter 
Never knew what the hell was coming next 
Seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . 
Appreciation of the daily 
Ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ... 
Most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned . '' 
Can act 
The tinny self-righteousness 
Damn weird 
, this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
The light-footed enchantment 
If you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . 
Left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence 
Best film 
That trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer 
Conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
A film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar 
It pushes its agenda too forcefully 
Awe-inspiring 
Said the film was better than saving private ryan 
The talk alone is enough to keep us 
A movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
Are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work 
Of high humidity 
It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . 
Is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true 
With only the odd enjoyably chewy lump 
Me no lika da accents so good , but 
An otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- 
It 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
Really rattling the viewer 
Painfully formulaic and stilted 
Of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes 
Causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen . 
Refreshing visit 
Comfortable 
Macabre 
Better-focused 
It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year . 
The product of loving , well integrated homage 
Favorably compared to das boot 
Thoroughly awful . 
Almost senseless 
Warm nor fuzzy 
Brutal 90-minute battle sequence 
Real women have curves truly is life affirming 
Barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 
Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . 
Sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations 
An intriguing story of maternal instincts 
To sell us on this twisted love story 
More than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch 
Reviewers 
's nothing interesting in unfaithful 
A fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development 
There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film . 
Recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room 
The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
Most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure 
You 've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it 's worth yet another visit . 
Beautifully realized 
Of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
A very resonant chord 
Sheer audacity and openness 
Character-who-shall - remain-nameless

Rendered tedious

Are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
Otherworldly 
Has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
There 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script 
A good way 
Loved this film 
, flawed humanity 
Of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories 
The whole mess 
Refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .

Reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
Story and his juvenile camera movements 
A lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan 's unique directing style 
Engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces 
Of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them 
Some major alterations 
Predictably efficient 
Leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb . 
Is sufficiently funny 
Greatest natural sportsmen 
Festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
Is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
Sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue

Offers an intriguing what-if premise 
Triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
Like it 
Suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject 
It 's all surface psychodramatics . 
A certain degree of wit and dignity 
Done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation 
You thought would leave you cold 
Will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
Are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations 
Though a capable thriller 
They are what makes it worth the trip to the theater . 
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but 
Choppy recycling 
Of above the rest 
Will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
Of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who 's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films

Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
Atrociously

To winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's forget paris 
Although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .

A wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing 
Who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers

With zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups 
Goes on for the 110 minutes of `` panic room '' 
Low-tech 
He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash . 
This one gets off with a good natured warning 
Sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both 
Real and 
've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles 
'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen 
Does hold up pretty well 
What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but 
Is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
Even more ludicrous 
A movie that deserves recommendation 
Unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery . 
Tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .

Yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner

Have the highest production values you 've ever seen 
Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant 
With the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances 
Pretty contagious fun 
Quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety 
Well-wrought 
( `` safe conduct '' ) is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . 
In the wrong hands 
But it 's just too too much 
Director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; 
More complete than indecent proposal 
Those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein 's life would do better elsewhere . 
Swooping down on a string of exotic locales 
Would n't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
Idiotic and ugly . 
The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery 
Of humankind 's liberating ability 
Ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
The dimming 
Elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with washington the actor . 
Endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer

So desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks 
Unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling .

Potentially trite and overused concept 
To the outstanding soundtrack 
The director mostly plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
The stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine 
Know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
Original and insightful 
Portrayed with almost supernatural powers 
Looks elsewhere , seizing on george 's haplessness and lucy 's personality tics . 
Pollyana would reach for a barf bag 
Influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh 
Memory , resistance and artistic transcendence 
If the full monty was a freshman fluke 
There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
Surprisingly uninvolving 
Low , smoky and inviting sizzle 
Adventure movie 
In its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
Hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian .

Ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .

Nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy 
Left with a sour taste in your mouth 
Character creations 
Alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous 
, whimsical feature 
The histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch 
Great films 
Does n't really add up to much . 
A lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness 
Stay 
Has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours 
Is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
Dislocation 
Honest performances and exceptional detail 
Buoyant , expressive flow 
A sub-formulaic slap in the face 
Wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
Affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes 
Slovenly life 
Made at least one damn fine horror movie 
Innovation 
, narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
How much he runs around and acts like a doofus 
A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood 
All the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream 
Clumsy and rushed 
The slack complacency of ( godard 's ) vision 
Haunting tale 
An extraordinary film 
To enter and accept another world 
Most slyly exquisite 
A masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice 
Mysterious , sensual 
Poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography 
`` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . 
His life drew to a close 
But uninvolving 
Is in his element here 
Delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
High-octane 
I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) . 
Rousing 
An imaginative teacher 
Popped up with more mindless drivel 
It 's mildly amusing , but i certainly ca n't recommend it . 
Be a total washout 
Make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
Deserves the hook 
You to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned 
Genuine acting 
Made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
As i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies 
Painful nuance 
A load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
Touching film 
One of the outstanding thrillers of recent years 
Insightful moments . 
Have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and 
A charm 
's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat 
Will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , 
Loser 
A sense-of-humour failure 
Grows on you -- like a rash 
Dim-witted pairing 
You 're not 
Complaint 
Of wit or charm 
Does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects 
That covers our deepest , media-soaked fears 
Bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
It seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little . 
Of the best ensemble casts of the year 
Such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
A minor miracle in unfaithful 
Undeniably hard 
Spits out denzel washington 's fine performance in the title role 
The criminal world 
Of extremely talented musicians 
Sandbox 
Indifference 
Meager weight 
Are worthwhile . 
Assured 
Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but 
The more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service 
The thing about guys like evans is this : you 're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins 
Interesting matters 
Most humane and important 
A documentary that works 
Thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie 
Yet lacking about everything 
Cuaron repeatedly 
Of the qualities that made the first film so special 
High-concept sci fi adventures 
So unsympathetic 
Gasp , shudder 
A fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters 
Thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer 
Screwed-up characters 
Feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
Difficult to connect with on any deeper level 
With style 
Between chaplin and kidman 
Is a convincing one , and 
A film so graceless and devoid

Uncle ralph 
Failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs 
Presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain 
Grisly 
Rather toothless 
Want to see it 
Welcomes 
Is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
Picked me up , swung me around , 
An esteemed writer-actor 
A few zingers aside 
The thing just never gets off the ground . 
The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme 's good films 
A witty , low-key romantic comedy . 
'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
Devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
Fiercely intelligent and 
Makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . 
But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
Unnamed , easily substitutable 
Kirkegaard 
With the exception of mccoist , the players do n't have a clue on the park . 
As well-characterized 
More fascinating 
It also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes 
's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre 
Mundane '70s disaster flick 
Sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful 
An 88-minute highlight reel 
Nothing funny 
Embarrassingly 
Marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain 
Together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers 
Got to me 
The action clich��s just pile up . 
Deserved co-winner 
M. night shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema 
Inept and 
Is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
Is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
Fascinating psychological fare 
( a ) soulless , 
Comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary 
The film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time . 
Enjoyable randomness 
's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn 
The rat-a-tat energy 
Is plenty of fun for all . 
Enough to keep men 
Take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
Lame musketeer 
Absurd 
Catapulting 
By shooting itself in the foot 
One relentlessly depressing situation 
Easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros 
Rather cold-blooded comedy 
Saccharine sentimentality 
While the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
Sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
Inconsequential 
Has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and 
The action clich��s 
A director to watch 
Can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? 
Spider-man 
Is reasonably entertaining , 
Aesthetically and sexually 
Rubbo 's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy . 
're often undone by howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject 
Relentlessly depressing 
The latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year 
Hard-to-swallow 
Scratch a hole in your head 
Disappointing in comparison 
Cult 
Is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible 
's stylishly directed with verve 
Artificial and opaque 
Does this so well 
To be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love 
Fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything 
The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin 
Makes two hours feel like four . 
The subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham 
It 's one long bore . 
Is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
Touching , transcendent love story 
Jealousy 
Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
Liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
Surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
Petty 
Right to be 
To keep this from being a complete waste of time 
Ultimate imax trip 
Entertainment 
'd expect to see on showtime 's ` red shoe diaries 
Is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades 
Badly awry 
A romantic comedy 
Has something significant to say 
Making a vanity project with nothing new 
Simplistic story 
A visually stunning rumination 
Itch to explore more 
We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art . 
Be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy 
An interesting slice 
Stilted 
Has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years 
Is insipid 
Plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going 
Fabricated 
, in an irresistible junior-high way , 
The picture runs a mere 84 minutes , 
Not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie 
Exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean 
Great saturday night live sketch 
Impressive job 
-- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying 
That is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
Passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese 
For something as splendid-looking as this particular film 
's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
Real vitality 
Everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth 
Of humor , verve and fun 
Garde 
Every cliche 
Genuine spontaneity 
This method almost never fails him 
This pretentious mess 
This method almost never fails him , and 
Expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , 
Better characters , 
To a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes 
As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , ( franco ) has all of dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
Are so overstated 
Too goodly , wise and knowing 
Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . 
In the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
Its first-time feature director 
Gives the lie to many clich��s and 
A small movie with a big impact . 
Very handsomely produced let-down 
A brilliant movie 
Make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger 
Of the human heart 
For its overwhelming creepiness 
Being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
Boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery . 
Of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances 
Delightfully compatible 
Stylish weaponry 
It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
Those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original 
Fine performances 
The movie 's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
Coherent rhythm 
Played and smartly directed 
Drew to a close 
's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism 
Wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot 
Manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference 
Used manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way 
Blandly 
No particular bite 
Less a story 
Is good , except its timing . 
A shrill , didactic cartoon 
Runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . ' 
Too predictably , in fact . 
Can enjoy 
' i feel better already . 
Since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously 
One key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
Incoherence reigns . 
Make it an above-average thriller 
Interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
A 95-minute commercial 
Bones tickled 
Tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet 
, the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation . 
Bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people 
Ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period 
Overbearing 
With soul 
Much as i laughed throughout the movie 
You do n't need to know your ice-t 's from your cool-j 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . 
The brilliance of animal house 
Once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable . 
, and intermittently hilarious 
Best thing 
Realized the harsh reality of my situation 
Awkward interplay and utter lack 
Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
Often exciting 
Is how the film knows what 's unique and quirky about canadians 
Emotional buttons 
Surprisingly sensitive script co-written 
Sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , 
Black hawk down and we were soldiers 
On the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction 
Do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation . 
Even the stuffiest cinema goers 
It at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored 
Much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
The power of strong voices 
Some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) 
Entertainment opportunism at its most glaring 
Impress 
His flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson 
A holy fool 
Still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it 
By the surprisingly shoddy makeup work 
The cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
Going nowhere fast 
Ambitious movie 
The highest power 
Be distasteful to children and adults alike 
Unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles 
Delivers fascinating psychological fare 
On great scares and a good surprise ending 
Are masterfully controlled . 
Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient 
`` shock humor '' 
Is one film that 's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . 
Feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us 
With an utterly incompetent conclusion 
Considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
A strong-minded viewpoint , or 
Generally smart 
Is born to play shaggy 
Becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
, rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
Ladles on the local flavor with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza . 
Rouses us . 
Compelling story 
Winning performances and 
, snide and prejudice . 
Working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
By a gritty style and an excellent cast 
Cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks 
The frequent allusions 
The film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
Exuberant openness 
... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
You might as well be watching a rerun 
A pedestrian , flat drama 
In the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d 
Of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness 
Is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol 
Are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ... 
His way to becoming the american indian spike lee 
Diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
Intrigued 
Of ( woo 's ) best work 
What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
Spice 
It 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative 
A movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
Of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure 
Even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost do n't notice the 129-minute running time . 
Idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea 
Filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability 
Overcomes the script 's flaws and envelops the audience in his character 's anguish , anger and frustration . 
Comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case 
Summer entertainment 
Distinct and very welcome sense 
Emotional misery 
What i saw , i enjoyed . 
Resemble the shapeless 
Sneering 
Wasted minutes of sandler 
, eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
Too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span 
As darkly funny , energetic , 
Cleaver 
That is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible 
Will capture the minds and hearts of many 
Family 
But undernourished and plodding . 
Worth checking out at theaters 
Seems embarrassed by his own invention and 
To have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense 
Preserving a sense of mystery 
Bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of `` his girl friday , '' maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . 
A grittily beautiful film that looks , 
Daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty 
Close to the level of intelligence and visual splendor that can be seen in other films 
Every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it 
Co-writer/director jonathan parker 's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
Such a flat , plodding picture 
Got a place in your heart for smokey robinson 
Laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , 
There 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction 
More than a movie 
Bad sound 
The impressively discreet filmmakers 
With spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
Imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor 
Tepid and choppy recycling 
Is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
Ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
Patriot 
The characters make italian for beginners worth the journey 
A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
May be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg 's work 
A rerun 
Smoke signals 
Gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior 
Rare quality 
The too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , 
A poignant comedy 
, inescapably gorgeous , 
Manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly 
Eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor 
Combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart 
Flower-power liberation 
Dull in its lack of poetic frissons 
As lax and limp a comedy as i 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material 
Grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
In sorrow 
After watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
Earnest performances 
A compelling coming-of-age drama 
A ' list cast 
Cast and surehanded direction 
Is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally 
Loved it 
So cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
Pretend like your sat scores are below 120 
Silly and monotonous 
Inventive , consistently intelligent 
Worst sin 
Need agile performers 
Unpredictable character 
Spin hopelessly out 
Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
Collapses under its own meager weight 
With the terrifying message 
A bit of a downer and a little 
Not-very-funny 
Splendidly cast pair 
Another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ... 
Redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world 's most generic rock star 
A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game 
The movie is hardly a masterpiece , 
Often downright creepy 
Detail 
Eats up the screen 
As graceful

The weak payoff 
Formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory

Mildly entertaining 
Richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , 
I 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and 
Of our respect 
Their project so interesting 
No big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
, you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
It 's not half-bad 
( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism 
Has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , 
Bad movies

Giddy and whimsical and relevant today

Unimaginable

Cutting-edge indie filmmaking 
Leaving questions in its wake 
Figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
Satire lucky break 
While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out 
Simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
Breathtaking 
Thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait 
The rare common-man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness 
Some good , organic character work , 
Students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously 
Just a string of stale gags , 
Too ludicrous and borderline insulting 
, lame screenplay 
The case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
Devastating 
's easy to like 
A ponderous and pretentious endeavor 
With a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking 
Most amazing 
The worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for 
Just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer . 
Dull moment 
Expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women . 
Good sense 
He 's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns ' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde

Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! 
An obvious rapport with her actors and

Touching , smart and complicated 
Angelina jolie 's surprising flair 
Self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash 
Cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances 
, colorful , semimusical 
A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
Leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach 
More likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine

Is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . 
The real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man 
Is of the darkest variety 
Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
Into splatter movies 
Derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved 
Instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way 
First real masterpiece

Strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
Dud from frame one . 
Maid in manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
Paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script 
Low-grade 
I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and 
A jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clich�� 
You 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live 
It 's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and 
It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america

Uneven performances 
Ingeniously constructed than `` memento '' 
A dreary movie . 
Like a well-made pb & j sandwich 
The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious

That never 
Of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure 
A jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week 
A successful one 
Found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style 
To our dismay 
Comparatively sane and healthy 
, obnoxious 88-minute 
This movie 's got it 
Putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
Sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices 
A string of ensemble cast romances recently 
To the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget 
Pointed , often tender , 
Sharp and 
Seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots 
Recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting 
The movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
Warmed-over cold war paranoia 
Is the most visually unappealing 
, the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
Current americanized adaptation 
An incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema 
Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy . 
Into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need 
Director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
Tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price 
At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . 
A very well-meaning movie , 
Was just a matter of ` eh 
Nature film and a tribute 
Does n't add up 
An incongruous summer playoff 
Beats new life 
Mundane soap opera 
Known as ' a perfect family film 
To arrest development in a dead-end existence 
Has several strong performances . 
Is not 
A perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity 
Lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made ( eyre 's ) first film something of a sleeper success 
A real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who 's ever waited in a doctor 's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
Somewhat tired premise 
Has something to say 
Love , communal discord , 
Into the urban heart 
Of good sense 
A light , 
There is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
Lasker 's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther ... realize they ca n't get no satisfaction without the latter . 
Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience 
It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least 
A flashy editing style that does n't always jell with sean penn 's monotone narration 
Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
Sell it 
Exceedingly memorable 
A fantastic movie 
Delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids 
Crash-and-bash action 
Slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
Gentle , endearing 
Happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and does n't pummel us with phony imagery or music . 
It 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb 
Turd squashed 
Knucklehead swill 
The weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
Decide what annoyed me most about god is great 
Like a mix of cheech and chong 
- kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked 
This predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip 
Self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman 
By an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot 
Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , 
We make underneath such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images 
No lika 
Is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience 
A teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo 
It 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
More timely than its director could ever have dreamed 
What is kind of special 
Missed opportunity 
Undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards 
The pianist ( is ) a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life 
, it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence 
Colors the picture in some evocative shades 
Undone 
Is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
Beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself 
Some cute moments , funny scenes , and 
Unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france 
Hardhearted scrooge 
7th heaven 
Ensues are much blood-splattering 
Unlike 
Rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language 
Dialogue and plot lapses 
It comes off as annoying rather than charming 
, labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . 
Manipulating our collective fear 
A number of holes 
, i do n't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
Good cinematography 
's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film . 
Despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes 
To imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one 
A shallow rumination on the emptiness of success 
Mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face 
His boisterous energy 
This a high water mark for this genre 
A fascinating character study 
Humor and 
The latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
Written , flatly , 
For a breath of fresh air now and then 
Far superior film 
A snore 
Song-and-dance-man 
A sharp script 
Assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni 's pinocchio -- 
Too predictable and 
A role of almost bergmanesque intensity 
Plodding 
None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
Goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so 
Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
Inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience 
Strong piece 
Earns extra points by acting as if it were n't 
The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
Is its utter sincerity . 
Manipulative and 
The plot offers few surprises 
Cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home 
It 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
Has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
Ends up being neither 
Consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
Construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis 
This distinguished actor 
Acute expressiveness 
Goes straight to video 
The obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay 
Might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults 
Sweet , tender sermon 
Gaping 
Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
Does n't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
Gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
With such clarity 
Enigma lacks it . 
Offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . 
A classic theater piece 
To a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments 
It thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
The most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
Lack contrast , are murky and 
Muddled , 
There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but peter mattei 's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note 
One of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies 
The rich promise of the script 
Bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
Some like it 
Promised ( or threatened ) for later this year 
Is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
An engaging story 
The film was better than saving private ryan 
As darkly funny , energetic , and 
Acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
No point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan 's prefeminist plight 
An interesting topic , some intriguing characters and 
Fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Seems aware of his own coolness 
A vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it 
That was old when ` angels with dirty faces ' appeared in 1938 
A chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion 
Marginal 
Is one of this year 's very best pictures 
Hyper-artificiality 
Place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics 
Sensuous and spirited tale 
's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted 
Scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics 
The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality 
Like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments 
A gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem 
Pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead 
A such a brainless flibbertigibbet 
Of tradition and warmth 
American adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place 
Ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness 
Splendid performances 
An elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 
Take the viewer inside the wave 
Watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises 
To these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy 
An overly sillified plot 
Too much to do , too little time to do it in 
, here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
Spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say 
That takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women 
Reminiscent of alfred hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen . 
For insights 
, juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre 
Got me grinning 
Is charming 
Tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
Supposedly funny 
Lovely and amazing is holofcener 's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is . 
Has a pleasing way with a metaphor 
Fairly slow paced 
And more than that , it 's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
Oddly detached 
's never dull 
A bad imitation 
Being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
That made the full monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work 
Shows deft comic timing . 
That wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago 
The need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 
Rich and luscious 
I pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
The dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory 
The man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
Resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative 
Why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? 
's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy 
Feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks 
All the same problems the majority of action comedies have 
Absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers 
Sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's 
Fulfilling 
Of the grieving process 
Sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . 
Either 11 times too many or else too few 
By the time it 's done with us , 
An engaging and moving portrait 
Wears out its limited welcome 
's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose . 
Yes , i suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so 
Could have been a daytime soap opera 
Memorable 
The crassness of this reactionary thriller 
Stuffiest cinema goers 
Satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , 
The filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l.a. to that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either . 
Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
Short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries 
Sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth 
Really bad imitation 
Goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling 
Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing 
Ca n't sustain it . 
Refreshed and hopeful 
To foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde 's classic satire 
A remarkable and novel concept 
Modernizes a.e.w. mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks `` the four feathers '' bare 
Somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton 
Special 
Could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format 
A spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch 
As history 
That a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients 
This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
Considerable charm 
Is enormously good fun . 
An enjoyable above average summer diversion . 
A good job 
That the franchise 's best years are long past 
The true impact of the day 
Is somewhat entertaining 
Gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she 's ever done . 
Pur��ed m��lange 
Thoroughly entertaining 
Certain charm 
It may not be a great piece of filmmaking , 
All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
The first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens 
Takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about 
Providing an experience that is richer than anticipated 
Obvious as telling a country skunk 
Is that it 's a brazenly misguided project . 
Enjoy it 
That good theatre 
For genre fans 
A pathetic exploitation film 
Queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- 
Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year 
A rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him 
Less as a documentary and more as a found relic 
Is a step down for director gary fleder . 
All in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
A serious movie 
's to this film 's ( and its makers ' ) credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves 
And good intentions 
Feels like a glossy rehash 
Pushes too hard 
Is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
Very charming and funny 
Seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers 
This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
Sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking 
Well-acted , 
Laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period 
Solid cast 
Damon and 
Too much obvious padding 
Talented director as chen kaige 
For once 
Even gritty enough 
This is not an easy film . 
Raw comic energy 
The real turns magical 
Its fun 
The proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing 
Could take me back to a time before i saw this movie 
That it has n't gone straight to video 
Accomplished work 
It 's plotless , shapeless 
Subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer 
Resonant film since the killer 
Is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little **** . 
Is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring . 
Along looking for astute observations and coming up blank 
, love . 
The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
Is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . 
Is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original 
Seem disappointing 
The face of death 
Nature and family warmth 
Horrendously 
Is a tale worth catching . 
The aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . 
That works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller 
Not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous 
The film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
A whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish 
... manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
Nebrida 
Gross romanticization 
Epics 
Is amazing , 
Of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged 
An intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind 
The inherent absurdity 
In the truest sense 
Of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen 
Another genre exercise , gangster no. 1 is as generic as its title . 
Avoid 
Carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others 
Works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times 
For most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why 
Is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend 
Was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy 
They ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up 
For nearly three hours 
Mean-spirited film 
Friend 
Deeply pessimistic or 
Made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's reign of fire . 
Colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
Instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza 
A fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
Bogs down in genre cliches here 
When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
Interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and 
, godfrey reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
A serious movie with serious ideas 
Breathe life into this somewhat tired premise 
Drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress 
A wry , affectionate delight . 
A gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity 
Sucks , but has a funny moment or two 
Has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
Goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better 
Uneven , 
Has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought 
Clich��d to a fault 
You laugh 
With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , ( crane ) becomes more specimen than character -- 
This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
A juicy writer 
Make you feel like a sucker 
's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects 
Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
It is generally amusing from time to time 
Soap opera-ish dialogue 
Complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones 
Poor 
Is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents 
Are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones 
Has been remarkable about clung-to traditions 
Terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most 
Two tedious 
A nearly terminal case 
Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . 
( t ) oo many of these gross out scenes ... 
Stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
As beautiful , 
Genial-rogue shtick 
Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense . 
Giggly 
Is a pretty decent little documentary . 
Purgatory county 
Best and most mature comedy 
An elegantly balanced movie 
Astonishingly skillful and moving ... it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one 
Is way , way off . 
Is the central flaw of the film 
Memorable cinematic experience 
Of the bad reviews 
Director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime 's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks 
We never feel anything for these characters , and 
Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike 
Though it 's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans ' saga of hollywood excess . 
Rumor 
Happy listening to movies 
The story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me 
Strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but 
A dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; 
Reach for a barf bag 
A heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way 
Genuine insight into the urban heart 
`` radical '' or `` suck '' 
Lurid and less 
A dead-end existence 
Sad nonsense , 
Tear their eyes away 
Run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
To invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets 
Scuzzy underbelly 
Larded 
Foundering performance 
Lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
Ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
Resident evil is not it 
Lead actress ga? , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren . 
Fighting the same fights 
Visually atrocious 
Poking their genitals into fruit pies 
The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing 
The hours , a delicately crafted film , 
A film of delicate interpersonal dances . 
A lousy one 
At the edge of your seat for long stretches 
Intimate contemplation 
Baffling mixed platter 
Finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful 
Non-exploitive approach 
The problem with all of this : it 's not really funny . 
From the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes 
A riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
Charmless 
Finely crafted , finely written , 
Shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time 
... unlike ( scorsese 's mean streets ) , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
An enthusiastic charm in fire that makes the formula fresh again 
A film about one of cinema 's directorial giants 
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
Odoriferous thing ... 
Strongest performance 
, your senses are as mushy as peas 
, no one can hear you snore 
Half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 
Cruel 
Relative letdown . 
Lushly photographed and beautifully recorded . 
The most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .

Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and 
A glorious spectacle 
Sensitive and astute 
Can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) 
An elegant work , food of love 
's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona . 
Vulgarity , sex scenes 
Most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars 
Sleep-inducingly 
Touching love story

Forget its absurdity 
Any naked teenagers horror flick 
Is not an easy film . 
Noticeable lack 
Of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much 
Ca n't get no satisfaction without the latter 
That 's where the film ultimately fails 
Even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold 
Their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people 
A coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clich��s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood 
The pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers

An intelligent flick 
A triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
Beautiful film to watch 
Can do no wrong with jason x. 
Lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo 
Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler 
Huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes 
Believing people were paid to make it 
Funniest idea 
Unbearably beautiful 
's updating works surprisingly well 
Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
This one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . 
Why did n't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
A bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 
Stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric 
What 's next ? 
If you saw it on tv , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
Love and 
Savvy director robert j. siegel and his co-writers 
Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears 
J. lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl . 
An evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness 
Doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves 
Is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 
Favor 
I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
Buried , drowned 
Is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .

Almost perpetually wasted 
Thoroughly enjoyable . 
Is painfully bad 
As naturally charming 
Overall , it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : 
Lacking substance and soul 
Bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material 
This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . 
Is dreamy and evocative 
Well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process 
A fair bit 
Makes it worth the trip to the theater 
Darkly funny 
Thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry 
Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy

Even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread 
Graceless and devoid 
Original hit movie 
His supple understanding of the role 
It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . 
Serious suspense 
Embarrassingly ham-fisted 
Her passionate , tumultuous affair

Like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , 
Gon na like this movie 
Forgiveness and love 
Why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad 
A sweet and sexy film 
A decent attempt 
Is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
You can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good . ' 
Timeless 
Is too heady for children , and too preachy 
A nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
Are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp 
Heart and unsettling subject matter 
That keeps you 
Misuse 
That flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch 
Vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
May not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting 
Cult classic 
Unflattering 
Delivers real bump-in - the-night chills 
What 's most memorable about circuit 
One thing 's for sure -- if george romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
An encouraging new direction 
Classy , sprightly spin 
Ca n't help but feel ` stoked . 
, sex with strangers is a success . 
Totally estranged from reality 
, delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
And poorly-constructed comedy 
Dreadful day 
Exploitation film 
A lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography 
A vivid personality 
The fist is hilarious 
See this terrific film with your kids -- 
Farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher 
The film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
Of creative belly laughs 
Controversy 
Needs to pull his head out of his butt 
It a step further , richer and deeper 
Is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin 
's hardly watchable 
An intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships 
Not amused by the sick sense of humor 
Are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday 
This rich and luscious 
Its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , 
It reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain 
The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
Needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the ` qatsi ' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
Oftentimes funny 
Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be 
Seem to be surefire casting 
Some intriguing characters 
Winning family story 
A charming , banter-filled comedy ... 
Alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
As moronic as some campus 
Ploddingly melodramatic structure 
Works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era 
Laugh as well . 
Original and highly cerebral 
Here seems to have recharged him . 
Waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
An impeccable study 
See her esther blossom as an actress 
Minority report '' astounds . 
By way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material 
Not well-acted 
In director randall wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency 
, the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject . 
Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases 
Wishy-washy . 
Each other so intensely , but with restraint 
Far more interesting 
Rugrats 
, insight and humor 
And mind games 
Unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema 
An engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
Love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
His characters stage 
A powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking 
While scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` gangs '' is never lethargic 
Was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson ... 
If you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen 
Is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
A fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . ' 
Keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
You 've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation 
The psychology too textbook to intrigue 
, it 's pretty stupid . 
Bravo for history 
Is a winner . 
Accepting him in the role 
Of businesses 
Is a dazzling conceptual feat 
, preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
An engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and 
Slightly naughty , just-above-average off - broadway play 
( b ) 
Which should appeal to women 
A nationwide blight 
Effectively creepy-scary thriller 
Brutally honest individual 
All this exoticism might sound to the typical pax 
Breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes 
Crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . 
Also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience 
More hackneyed elements 
Is as lax and limp a comedy as i 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair 
, in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
Mesmerizing performance 
If you 're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . 
An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle 
Is more depressing than entertaining 
Wrong reasons 
Wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals . 
Put in service 
To interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor 
Are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . 
It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not 
Is sympathetic without being gullible 
A great and a terrible story 
Negligible british comedy . 
Sacrificing its high-minded appeal 
Warm 
Sweet home alabama is n't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts 
Beautiful , aching sadness 
They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . 
's compelling 
Whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude 
Simplistic , silly and tedious . 
Who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little 
To realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
As he was about inner consciousness 
Ugly , pointless , stupid movie 
It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . 
, amusing and unsettling 
Rolling your eyes in the dark 
, stylized humor throughout 
No charm , 
I 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich�� 
If only merchant paid more attention the story . 
Is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving 
Have its charms 
Does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that 
Every punchline predictable 
No psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract 
Feral and uncomfortable . 
Bogus 
Are typical sandler fare 
Plenty of fun for all 
Of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast 
A colorful , joyous celebration of life 
George 's haplessness 
Loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . 
Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman ca n't save it . 
Compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness 
A charismatic charmer 
On a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness 
Both the beauty 
The riveting performances 
Bouncing bravado 
, no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
Should have been a painless time-killer 
A minimalist beauty 
It 's drab . 
An admirable reconstruction 
Gifted performers 
So often end up on cinema screens 
The script 's bad ideas and awkwardness 
On televised scooby-doo shows or reruns 
Is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer 
Romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going 
Good action , good acting 
As emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions 
Frustratingly timid and soggy 
's real visual charge to the filmmaking 
Have preceded it 
A convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely 
Because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget 
Had a wonderful account to work from 
Barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely 
( soderbergh ) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
A community-college advertisement 
Asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives 
Caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
A mischievous visual style 
Call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
Interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
Warmth 
Behind bars 
The all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story 
Is notable for its sheer audacity and openness 
, steven soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
This is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned . 
A bit exploitative but also nicely done 
The love 
More than merely a holocaust movie 
Have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort 
Was painful 
Charismatic enough 
The trip there is a great deal of fun . 
Manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . 
In the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
Keeps throwing fastballs 
Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl�� . 
Is that it does n't give a damn 
Spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don ' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
Walked out of runteldat 
Keep watching the skies for his next project 
The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow 
Land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 
's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form 
Want the story to go on and on 
This is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; 
Woefully hackneyed 
A brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel 
Re-fried 
Worthy of the price of a ticket 
Hope 
Was just a matter of ` eh . ' 
Carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . '' 
A better person 
One summer film that satisfies 
So unmemorable

Of purpose 
I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . 
It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison .

It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .

Wondering why lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery 
The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing 
Romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present hollywood program .

We also need movies like tim mccann 's revolution no. 9 . 
As a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times 
It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring 
Is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications 
The wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism 
To see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity 
Is corcuera 's attention to detail . 
Has been lost in the translation ... another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .

A great cast 
Such superficial treatment 
Admirable storyteller 
Ludicrous 
It celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light . ' 
Sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell 
Deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone 
Limitations 
About one in three gags in white 's intermittently wise script hits its mark 
Meyjes ... has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
The astute direction 
If hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clich�� 
A mystery how the movie could be released in this condition 
Pan nalin 's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . 
Conservative christian parents

Catapulting the artist 
By someone who obviously knows nothing about crime 
A perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it 
On its way 
There 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance . 
Beautiful , entertaining two hours 
The edge of your seat , tense with suspense 
It 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome 
Views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations 
Captivates and shows 
Is horrible 
The dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor 
Increasingly disturbed 
Is less about a superficial midlife crisis 
Something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere 
A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
An undeniably fascinating and playful fellow 
Paper thin 
That is gorgeously 
Not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works 
, the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son . 
Sprightly 
It was worth your seven bucks 
That drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category 
Will please eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man 
Becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if . '' 
It can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
Is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses 
Lilo & stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen 
Repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences 
It 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish 
In the end it 's as sweet as greenfingers 
Has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores 
You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .

A sentimental mess that never rings true 
The story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
, this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
Matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise 
If you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . 
Is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .

Hands-on storytelling 
Repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but 
Eighties 
Little room 
There is n't much to it . 
That it 's actually watchable 
Dispassionate 
Strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful 
In a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
Good for this sucker 
Wrapping the theater 
Visual coming right 
Halfwit 
But it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
Slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and 
Gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she 's ever done 
The giant screen and its hyper-realistic images 
Jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , 
A well-mounted history lesson 
Works , it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance . 
A clich�� left unsaid 
Is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
That it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead

) fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard 
, ( ahola ) has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation . 
It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but 
Of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout 
Lots of sloppiness 
Any country 
There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , 
What 's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm . 
Its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
Gain the unconditional love she seeks 
An earnest moment 
Female friendship , 
, at last count , numbered 52 different versions 
The history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . 
Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clich��s . 
From bill plympton , the animation master , 
The two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances 
Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this 
Friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
Rouses us 
The adjective ` gentle ' 
Check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on . 
The film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but it 's smooth and professional . 
A chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933

Screen magic 
Deathly 
Liked about schmidt a lot 
A sensitive and astute 
Shooting 
May put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
An encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence 
On its taut performances and creepy atmosphere 
Love and culture 
Confusing melange 
This dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
A golden book sprung to life 
Is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand 
Been given a part worthy of her considerable talents 
Recommend the film 
Weighted down with slow 
Twisted , brilliant and macabre 
His own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality

Frailty '' has been written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit ! '' 
Make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable 
Gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
A strong and confident work 
In this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
Largely flat and uncreative 
Of almost perpetually wasted characters 
A tearjerker 
Does all of this , and more 
Surprise family 
Demeaning its subjects 
Raw-nerved story 
Celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light . ' 
I loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
Excited 
That as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances 
Executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and 
, paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
A slam-dunk 
Does n't really add up to much 
Wiseman is patient 
Improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end 
Putting together any movies of particular value or merit 
Bang your head on the seat in front of you , 
I was beginning to hate it 
Cultural and personal self-discovery 
To be ignored

Disastrous ending 
Vibrant introduction 
A critical and commercial disaster 
Mad love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , 
Benefit enormously from the cockettes ' camera craziness -- 
Major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee 
Tremendous skill

Straightforward and strikingly devious 
Far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid 
Help but engage an audience 
One of the greatest films 
Makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison 
Crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment 
This is a movie you can trust . 
Nails all of orlean 's themes without being a true adaptation of her book 
Sustain a good simmer for most of its running time 
You 'll probably love it . 
Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia 's true emotions ... but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking 
Pompous references 
Be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest 
Ambitious comic escapade 
Has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie 
For most movies , 84 minutes is short , 
Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
Replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around 
Remain interested , or at least conscious 
In the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest . 
A dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain 
If the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
It 's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller 
Worthwhile glimpse 
Of enthralling drama 
Begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times 
Insufficiently cathartic

Does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this 
Who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the ` qatsi ' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ?

The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots . 
Maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling . 
Heavyweight film 
's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
A pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation 
With a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance 
The silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing 
With lots of sloppiness 
Of his passe ' chopsocky glory 
Sheer unbridled delight 
For on-screen chemistry 
Mass drug-induced bowel 
The whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
A fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . 
Imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma 
Its underventilated p��re-fils confrontations

According to wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
Salma goes native and she 's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
Julia roberts wannabe 
Sure , it 's contrived and predictable , but

Petter n?ss ' delicate , clever direction ... and

Has been overexposed , 
That he will once again be an honest and loving one 
Is an interesting character 
Keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s.c. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
So intensely , but with restraint 
Yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction 
The next inevitable incarnation of the love boat 
Has an infectious enthusiasm 
Succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful

Most entertaining bonds 
Expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school 
Sane person 
Marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances 
A goofy pleasure 
Compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction 
Penetrating , 
A delightful lark 
While the highly predictable narrative falls short 
Multilayered 
's fun for kids of any age 
Welcome and heartwarming addition 
Right-wing , propriety-obsessed family 
Pc stability notwithstanding 
Of moral compromise 
You have no affinity for most of the characters . 
Enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games 
Occasional jarring glimpses 
Will find it more than capable of rewarding them 
All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
The discomfort and embarrassment 
The horrible pains of a death 
Most notable 
Under the right conditions , it 's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun 
Bad luck

Feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
That seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again

To much more than trite observations on the human condition 
Is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
A predictable outcome and a screenplay 
Kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . 
, blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
Believed in their small-budget film 
This silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller 
It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
Are too crude to serve the work especially well 
's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles 
Energetic frontman 
So sloppily written 
Sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form 
As one of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences 
Without placing their parents in a coma-like state 
From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
Bring cohesion

Such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many 
Discreet filmmakers 
Chilling movie 
Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
Its good qualities are obscured 
, the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting . 
This bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery 
Completely loveable 
Vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans ' saga of hollywood excess 
In the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller 
: the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen 
After decades 
Much credit 
Tv sitcom material at best 
It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , 
Never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks 
Shrill and 
Has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past 
An inexperienced director , 
At the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes 
Keep you watching , 
What it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in 
A lousy one at that 
Does n't always jell with sean penn 's monotone narration 
The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , 
Refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm 
For its profound humanity 
As simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming 
But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
Refusal to recognize any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map 
The man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness 
, every bit as imperious as katzenberg 's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
Are just two of the elements that will grab you . 
A dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair 
Heartfelt and hilarious 
You reach the finale 
Easily marketable 
If anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans . 
Churn out one mediocre movie 
Overall it 's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
Reading lines from a teleprompter 
This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc 's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
Its oscar nomination 
Characteristically engorged 
The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
's fun , wispy , 
For all its problems ... the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring ... which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
Replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy 
Complex and honest 
Uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave 
Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels . 
Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... 
An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything 
Dumb comedy 
There 's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is 
Drudgery 
Stripped almost entirely 
Despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving 
To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest 
Rowdy slapstick 
That rarity among sequels 
Torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera 
The film , flaws and 
Like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : 
Is marveilleux . 
Cheered at just that 
Have n't laughed that hard in years ! 
It has considerable charm . 
A work of deft and subtle poetry 
There is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film 
Integrating the characters in the foreground 
Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
As the movie sputters 
Embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 
Manages never to grow boring ... which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience

A so-called ` comedy '

First-class road movie

An electric pencil sharpener 
Loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion 
Wonderful but sometimes confusing 
If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
Nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them 
Of mindless pace in collision 
Be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this 
The effort is sincere 
Is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
The junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career 
Works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making 
The hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
Deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip 
Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .

Cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
Need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
A clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties 
Witty updatings ( silver 's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
Adroit 
May lack the pungent bite of its title , but it 's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 
's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
The national lampoon film franchise

Scratching your head 
To sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once 
A lump of run-of-the-mill profanity 
All comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
Of the biggest disappointments of the year 
Waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one 
A finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller

Imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie 
Mindless action movie 
The story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult 
Quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins 
The plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament 
Even as it points out how inseparable the two are

Work up 
Stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . 
Accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
Take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
Little gem

The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
A listless and desultory affair 
Like mike is n't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous 
It 's also undeniably exceedingly clever 
This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . 
A bottom-feeder sequel 
Run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and 
Is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham 
... has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .

The success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
Haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 
Reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but 
Is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
Supremely kittenish 
Anemic 
The end result does no justice to the story itself 
Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
Do n't avert our eyes for a moment .

At least during their '70s heyday 
Most original

More mindless 
His work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories .

Director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place 
Tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
Has n't much more to serve than silly fluff 
It 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor 
A hit - 
Outdoes its spectacle 
One senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .

Gay-niche condescension 
Hate it because it 's lousy . 
Understated performances of ( jack nicholson 's ) career 
Even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... 
Much like a fragment of an underdone potato 
Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set 
A distinguished and thoughtful film 
At the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside .

This is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
A clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film 
Of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought

A silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ?!? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .

Colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill .

Powerful , chilling , and affecting study

An unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
Still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
To the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience 
More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers

The movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .

Replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo 
Some very good acting , dialogue , 
As its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice 
`` mr. deeds '' is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
Blue crush is as predictable as the tides . 
As plain and pedestrian as catsup 
Ambitious failure 
Five hours long 
Is like reading a research paper 
Fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
Mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good 
Even if you 've seen `` stomp '' ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
, the movie is powerful and provocative . 
( it 's ) a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
Thrusts the audience 
Underwhelming 
We all lose track of ourselves by trying 
Folks , it does n't work . 
Enter 
Is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
Sobering cautionary tale 
Breathtakingly spectacular 
This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
The brilliant surfing photography 
Margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken . 
Vibrant charm 
Seagal ran out of movies years ago , 
That stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable 
The darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel 
Plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms 
An ugly , pointless , stupid movie 
The powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
Sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act 
An engaging storyline 
As timely as tomorrow 
As entertainment 
Is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback 's heidegger - and nietzsche-referencing dialogue 
Unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing 
Creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters 
Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers , 
Flourish 
Better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
Good actors 
Beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
The gallic ` tradition of quality 
So short 
Of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys 
The most awful acts 
Sinks to a harrison ford low . 
Manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
Eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life . 
The term epic cinema 
Never becomes claustrophobic 
Unbearably dull 
Sane and healthy 
Report that it is instead a cheap clich�� 
Is painterly . 
Shakespeare 's macbeth 
Their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own 
Quite admirable 
Introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , 
Takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving 
Talented writer/director anderson 
None of the visual wit of the previous pictures 
In full consciousness 
Will laugh their *** off for an hour-and-a-half 
Creeps into your heart . 
The smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools 
Engaging charisma 
Queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame 
A compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message 
Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
Is a trove of delights 
It is nevertheless compelling 
Delight in the images 
This year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes 
Of your seat , tense with suspense 
, tender hug 
From a groundbreaking endeavor 
Going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend 
To little more than punishment 
Geared 
There may have been a good film in `` trouble every day , '' but 
, the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
It 's sweet . 
A sad and rote exercise 
Bilingual charmer 
Of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own 
It 's a lousy one at that . 
Get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , 
Imaginative through out 
Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
Offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else 
Never feels draggy 
For its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd 
A fascinating case study 
Been remarkable 
A film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart 
Have a whale of a good time 
Seem to get a coherent rhythm going 
Gender-bending comedy 
Than the real thing 
Captured the chaos of an urban conflagration 
Unbelievably stupid 
Long , dull procession 
, really , really good things can come in enormous packages 
Great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no. 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience . 
Juicy role 
With action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering 
It might just be the movie you 're looking for . 
For no one 
Asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country 
The same love story 
Utter tripe 
Bland hotels 
The work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . 
Finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films 
The slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
, shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . 
Captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction 
Good as the original 
Genuine and singular artist 
Has made its way into your very bloodstream 
Tedium 
'd watch these two together again in a new york minute 
Ambitious ` 
It 's so lackluster 
Julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent . 
May be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
A really funny movie 
Imagine acting that could be any flatter 
Ago 
A man in drag is not in and of himself funny 
Worthy and 
The characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours 
A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
That rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday 
Is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand . 
To look at or understand 
One thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company 's previous video work . 
To fully endear itself to american art house audiences 
Those prone to indignation need not apply ; 
Visually fascinating ... an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
That he 's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary 
Starts out like a typical bible killer story 
To the scuzzy underbelly of nyc 's drug scene 
Worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
Ineffective 
Lush , swooning melodrama 
Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short 
's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . 
Tried-and-true 
Of sensitive observation 
Cathartic 
Frittered away 
The wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , 
Too amateurish and 
, they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
Humor , warmth , and intelligence 
Is lacking any real emotional impact 
A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` 
A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
Its visual panache 
I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
No discernible feeling 
Beauty or humor 
Cold , gray 
The one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 
Is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side 
Ultimately empty 
To champion the fallibility of the human heart 
Surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot 
Is just too clich��d and too often strains credulity 
Quiet power 
Off his game 
By sending the audience straight to hell 
The year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes 
On screen been so aggressively anti-erotic 
Brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors 
Maddening 
Figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats .

Melodramatic bodice-ripper

Shameless self-caricature 
Foreman 's barking-mad taylor to thewlis 's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell 's hard-eyed gangster 
Bludgeoning the audience over the head 
Like the best of godard 's movies 
No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
That feels dusty and leatherbound 
Of the worst titles in recent cinematic history 
Had been developed with more care 
Is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it 
Retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
's far from fresh-squeezed 
Huge heart 
A happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling 
Quirky , charming and 
To the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row 
Tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen george roy hill 's 1973 film , `` the sting . '' 
Is authentic . 
An intense indoor drama 
With aplomb 
Have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own 
Looks fake 
Feel the beat down to your toes 
Love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence 
Perfectly 
Boring , pretentious waste 
Is a dud . 
The fact that it is n't very good 
You do n't understand what on earth is going on

About a superficial midlife crisis 
An action/thriller of the finest kind 
A buoyant romantic comedy 
Is felt ; not the craven of ' a nightmare on elm street ' or ` the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` deadly friend . 
Will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action 
Kwan 's unique directing style 
The town has kind of an authentic feel , but 
Examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling 
Demonic 
The story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
Keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . 
Weird and distanced 
Never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
Because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm 
Borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own 
This long and relentlessly saccharine film 
Conflicts 
Offer any new insight 
Bring out joys in our lives 
What critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure 
, herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
Of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions 
Frightful vanity film 
Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
The process comes out looking like something wholly original 
A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated 
Uniquely 
Shoddy product 
You 'd be wise to send your regrets 
Perdition 
Its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace

Exploiting 
Hypocritical 
A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls .

Resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .

Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
Evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters 
Virtually no understanding of it 
The tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers 
Embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it 
Run-of-the-mill 
A strong pulse 
Star power

Cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory

A poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them

Odd and intriguing 
Awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
Every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones 's diary 
A wickedly undramatic central theme

The end of the world 
Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
A head-turner -- thoughtfully written , 
That are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane 
Usual tear

A sultry evening 
Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr. chips off the old block .

Live-wire film 
This story still seems timely and important . 
Deliciously exploitative 
Geniality 
Brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life 
Sloppy , made-for-movie 
Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all 
An interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate 
That deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty 
One mediocre movie

That 's apparently just what ( aniston ) has always needed to grow into a movie career

Delicate treatment 
Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .

The proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and 
Obscure this movie 's lack of ideas 
Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
Brings to a spectacular completion one 
Satisfactory overview 
Observant , unfussily poetic meditation 
Looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
Dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding 
Has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
The big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you 
Have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd 
Normally , rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
Samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
And pulp melodrama 
Of the vulgar , sexist , racist humor 
Historic 
, but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
Brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke 's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt . 
In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message 
Forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s 
With the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
Expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .

A fascinating , bombshell documentary 
Is pure punk existentialism 
The most ingenious film 
Cloying messages and irksome characters 
Knows its classical music , knows its freud and 
His ( nelson 's ) screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
Touching british comedy 
Beautifully shot , 
Is as adult as you can get 
Otherwise good 
Provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 
Vividly 
Fresh 
An unflinching and objective look 
A solid base hit . 
Amateurish 
Plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . 
I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie . 
Has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny 
The satire is weak . 
Sitcomishly predictable and cloying 
That parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination 
Enigma is well-made

Gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences 
Replacing john carpenter 's stylish tracking shots

Mannered 
Of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly 
Treasure chest 
Is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
A heroine

A special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento ...

Quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy 
One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us 
A fine , old-fashioned-movie movie 
Pinnacle 
90-plus 
To churn out one mediocre movie after another 
Strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss 
An overcooked souffl�� 
Sinks further and further into comedy futility 
Grotesque and boring 
No character , loveable or otherwise 
Is the best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years 
Sincerely crafted picture 
Is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact 
Tricky and satisfying as any of david 
It 's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
Exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . ' 
Filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life 
Such life-embracing spirit 
Ultimately , `` mib ii '' succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n't be dismissed as mindless . 
A stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle 
All the filmmakers need to do 
In dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm 
When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and 
A sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth 
Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` unfaithful . '' 
Even with its $ 50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
In a doctor 's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office 
A timid , soggy near miss . 
We often reel in when we should be playing out 
Contemplative , and 
Wonderful , imaginative 
Limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists 
Been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened 
Enormously endearing 
Hate it for the same reason 
Unusually surreal 
Less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) . 
Little morality tale 
Was n't as bad as i thought it was going to be 
Too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery 
One of the best silly horror movies 
Strokes the eyeballs 
Low-brow humor , 
A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions 
Makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . 
The humor wry and 
Writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavor with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza . 
Too weak a recipe 
Dishonesty 
Weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school 
A literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit wo n't be disappointed 
Look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
My only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and 
Very well-acted 
As moronic as some campus gross-out films 
Zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that 's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 
To bowling you over 
The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest 
Probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .

Lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise 
Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner laurence coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage 
Has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones 
Charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular 
A much funnier film 
It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , 
Near miss 
Yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state 
In more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable

The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .

To keep it from being maudlin 
An interest 
Lacks depth .

An enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences ... the chateau 
Never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together 
Another generic drama 
Typical anim�� , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
The recording sessions 
Of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theaters 
The rare imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour . 
Shapeless inconsequential move 
Annoying , 
By not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable . 
With the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors 
A choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise 
Wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths 
And artistic transcendence 
Tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot 
Treat . 
Retaining an integrity 
Look ill at ease sharing the same scene . 
A natural sense for what works 
Throw elbows when necessary 
Very sluggish 
This overproduced piece 
As ugly as the shabby digital photography and 
Makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
A funny moment 
Frailty '' starts out like a typical bible killer story 
Some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , 
Payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast 
Eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
Noisy and pretentious

An intensely lived time , 
Employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing 
Of goofball stunts any `` jackass '' fan 
Brave 
Sinister inspiration 
But no-nonsense human beings they are and 
Competent , unpretentious entertainment

Tooled action thriller about love and terrorism 
Putrid writing , direction and timing 
Breezy blend 
If ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
Attracting audiences 
Whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

Jump cuts , fast editing 
In the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage 's war-weary marine . 
Has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience 
An overexposed waste of film 
Most of the characters forget their lines 
Just that it 's so not-at-all-good 
Listless , witless , 
Handsome 
A few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock 
Airless cinematic shell games . 
Next to little insight 
Mcwilliams 's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , 
Cheesy backdrops 
Peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , 
Like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge 
Must have been lost in the mail 
Utter lack 
Beneath otherwise tender movements 
If this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad 
Follow-your-dream 
Is no denying the power of polanski 's film 
Match his ambition 
, virulently unpleasant excuse 
The confusing sexual messages 
Queasy infatuation and overall strangeness 
Of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow 
Really solid woody allen film 
Opulent 
With splendid singing 
This noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history 
An intelligent person 
Small , sweet ` evelyn 
If you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images 
Desolate 
The wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals 
His girl friday , '' maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes 
To break free of her old life 
These days are about nothing 
Terrific casting 
It feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
Their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment 
Is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent 
Emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort 
Auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera ... 
Stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits 
Technically proficient and 
A chilly , brooding but quietly 
Lazy exercise 
Predictable than their consequences 
Proper home 
His beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress 
Is rather unexceptional 
Under-inspired , overblown enterprise 
Like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen 
Inject farcical raunch 
Injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
Is their resemblance to everyday children . 
Will wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned . 
A fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
Is one of the best actors there is 
Is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable 
A remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , 
Is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
Ugly and destructive 
Baaaaaaaaad movie 
As a detailed personal portrait 
Delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation 
Feel sanitised and stagey 
Direct-to-video/dvd 
That the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination 
Fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but 
Difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 
Crane 's decline with unblinking candor 
Written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors 
Sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy 
More of : spirit , perception , conviction 
The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon . 
Teeth-clenching 
The movie is brilliant , really . 
Entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal 
So you can get your money back 
Timid and soggy 
Can be made on the cheap 
Barely realize your mind is being blown . 
Light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy 
( a ) stale retread of the '53 original . 
Of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme 
Abhorrent 
Feels painfully redundant and inauthentic 
Make it well worth watching 
After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clich��s , depression and bad alternative music . 
Integrating the characters 
Brave and 
In an increasingly important film industry and worth the look 
Modestly surprising movie 
Boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other 
They ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
Wondrous beats 
A predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen 
To truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining 
Ability to shock and amaze 
Another tired old vision 
A fascinating character 's 
By way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness 
A tough pill to swallow 
More adventurous 
Than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point 
Too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
Rings false 
Sustains the level of exaggerated , stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit 
Human nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; 
More than their unique residences 
... strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
Not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
Of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay 
The flowering of the south korean cinema 
( and lovely ) experiment 
George and lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks 
A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
Undeniably fascinating and playful 
Too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
Crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope 
This stinker 
Piercing and feisty 
Is one of my least favorite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
Before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
Not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
Urban comedy 
Exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk 
Is a brilliant movie . 
Feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal 
Was worse . '' 
It has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup 's anchoring performance . 
Leaden and predictable 
Above-average thriller 
An elegant and sly deadpan 
Civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices 
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and 
High-strung but flaccid drama 
Guiding lights 
Reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script 
`` b + 
One of france 's most inventive directors 
Sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little . 
Tenacious 
The brain is engaged 
Are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction 
Is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor 
About the life 
`` elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases 
Engaging manner and flamboyant style 
Cinematic 
To his craft , but to his legend 
... hypnotically dull . 
Is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his 
Yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless 
Other foul substances 
Mounted , exasperatingly 
About the general absurdity of modern life 
None of this is very original , and 
To behold in its sparkling beauty 
Is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . ' 
Brisk hack job . 
Teacher 
It all unfolds predictably 
Its empty head 
Is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film 
, this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
A remarkably alluring film 
For sure 
A fun and funky look 
Have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama 
Has failed him 
For everyone 
Rather unique approach 
Is oscar-worthy 
Watching intelligent people making a movie 
The modern master 
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
Is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys 
-- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- 
Warped 
Launch 
As if a bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet 
One that was hard for me to warm up to 
Brought down by lousy direction . 
An even less capable trio of criminals 
Be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor 
For the last 15 minutes 
A superfluous sequel ... 
Too convoluted 
With few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
The pictures do the punching 
Terrific casting and solid execution 
Thrillers actually thrilled 
Is the sense that peace is possible 
Valley of the dolls 
How good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
Worm its way into your heart 
Spellbinding serpent 's 
Becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on 
Funniest motion 
Fondly remembered as roman coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about 
The stale plot and pornographic way 
Handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly 
Is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . 
Ebullient 
Takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
Its visual appeal 
Once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie 
Windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
Wholly believable and heart-wrenching 
Frightfest 
Look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor 
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' 
The dullest tangents 
Switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
Empty head 
Star power , a pop-induced score 
Smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - broadway play 
Forget about it 
Feel like a chump 
Focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness 
Wo n't enjoy the movie at all 
Same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept 
Takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
Effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention 
Great rewards 
Should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free 
Is a mess . 
Too clich��d and 
Being able to tear their eyes away from the screen 
Terrifying message 
Telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal 
Compromising that complexity 
One experiences mr. haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience 
Suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories 
Has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed 
With brooms and what is kind of special 
Is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
Tight and truthful 
Appeal to asian cult cinema fans and asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about 
Lots of cool stuff packed into espn 's ultimate x. 
Seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
With all the mounting tension of an expert thriller 
Formulaic and forgettable 
You have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma 
Effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres 
With muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch 
Candid , 
You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like 
More sophisticated and 
This turd squashed 
Show-stoppingly hilarious , 
Director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
Is still worth hearing 
Right conditions 
's film ' in the worst sense of the expression . 
Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... 
Than a leaky freighter 
Dying fall 
Ignore the film 
You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny 
That brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability 
An insult 
Gentle , lapping 
Rise above the level of an after-school tv special 
Muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible 
Feel like time fillers between surf shots 
Presume 
You 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions 
The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier 's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( `` laissez-passer '' ) wears its heart on its sleeve . 
Found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
Shamelessly manipulative and contrived 
Lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name 
Much like a young robert deniro 
Altogether creepy 
Jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- 
Has any sting to it 
See over and over

Thriller junk . 
Seeing this trite , predictable rehash 
Surprisingly funny 
Mr. polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr. spielberg 's 1993 classic . 
Jump-in-your-seat moment 
, this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
The viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
It 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation 
It rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
Chamber of secrets 
Film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
Sublime 
How 
A rustic retreat and pee against a tree 
The working out of the plot almost arbitrary 
It also will win you over , in a big way 
Seem tiresomely simpleminded 
Director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting ` chops ' and 
Prime mystery 
It will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker 
About intelligent high school 
An achievement 
Were the people who paid to see it . 
An engaging storyline , 
Almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and 
Too much exploitation and too little art

Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period 
A delightfully dour 
It trusts the story it sets out to tell .

Becomes an overwhelming pleasure 
To be even worse than its title 
Grossly contradictory 
The premise of `` abandon '' holds promise , ... but 
Might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
It still feels like a prison stretch . 
Are many tense scenes in trapped 
This movie directionless 
The film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
The art direction is often exquisite , 
A beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters 
Might deliver again and again 
Scores a direct hit 
A humorless journey into a philosophical void .

Take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly 
Fine documentary

Nelson 's intentions are good 
A compelling allegory about the last days of germany 's democratic weimar republic 
It 's black hawk down with more heart . 
A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
Otherwise bleak

Knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest .

There 's an admirable rigor to jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down . 
A dull , dumb and derivative horror 
's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd 
Becomes too heavy for the plot . 
Loud , violent and mindless 
The film certainly does n't disappoint . 
Here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
Craziness

Graham greene 's novel 
A venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director 's understanding of the expressive power of the camera .

Improves on it , 
Bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 
It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .

An original idea 
Is banal in its message and the choice of material 
All was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
A whole lot of nada 
The bodily function jokes are about what you 'd expect , 
Hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
Collateral damage is trash ,

Very dark and very funny 
Prostituted muse

He makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty 
Was chuckling at all the wrong times 
It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . 
Seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar

Formulaic 
An eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion 
Lame screenplay

Overflows 
Austerity and forcefulness 
Sensational denouements 
Studiously inoffensive 
A gem of a movie . 
Far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year 's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
That made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes 
Say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets

The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders 
The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
This is a remarkably accessible and haunting film . 
This charming but slight tale

Inane 
Teddy bears ' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing 
That the jury who bestowed star hoffman 's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002 's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off 
Faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers 
A dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story 
Highly predictable 
A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing .

Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .

Friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
The self-destructiveness 
Lightweight but appealing . 
Its courage , 
Feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards 
Makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul 's perspective 
Mr. wollter and ms. seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear 
Ambiguous enough to be engaging 
It holds itself 
With overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers 
Mr. wollter and ms. seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but 
Pulpy core conceit 
Has never been smoother or more confident

Small but rewarding comedy 
The wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting 
Closer than many movies 
A party political broadcast 
Dumb high school comedy 
An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .

Of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title 
Cutting-edge 
A cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .

The punch lines 
Imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .

Obsessively

Is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
The kind of art shots that fill gallery shows 
Are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort 
Smug or sanctimonious 
Just lazy 
Is like sitting in a downtown caf�� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables 
To the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line 
Intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix 
Intriguing and realistic 
No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .

Hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
The conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes 
What sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
Is hartley 's least accessible screed yet

To resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on showtime 's ` red shoe diaries 
Speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates 
Woven together handsomely 
To cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses 
To imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
The verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them 
Kooky which should appeal to women

The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
Positively thrilling combination 
Energy and geniality 
Same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it 
Split up so that it can do even more damage 
High crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it ca n't help but engage an audience . 
For proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls 
The year 's greatest adventure , and jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation 
The lively intelligence 
Reasonably intelligent 
Until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
It may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case 
Is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure 
Warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message .

Inconclusive ending 
Strong directorial stamp 
A comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life 
Cool . 
Not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like 
The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . '' 
As an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice 
Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap

The film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . 
The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about . 
The film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
Adaptation 's success 
Genitals 
Nearly epic 
The bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .

The piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
Obsessive love 
Of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic 
There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
It could have been something special 
Works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely

Appalling , 
Interested in entertaining itself 
A mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion 
Is wise 
Its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work 
Himself can take credit for most of the movie 's success . 
Vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny 
An engaging and moving portrait of a subculture 
A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ...

Funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot

Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .

Psychotic 
Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
To the head of the class of women 's films 
Psychological thriller 
The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
Its sense of fun or energy 
An eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 
Could have -- should have -- been allowed 
Sade achieves the near-impossible

There 's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
A powerful look at a failure of our justice system 
Both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting 
Sleep-inducing thriller 
Delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that 's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance

Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea 
This junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
Content and narrative strength 
It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
Wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial 
A grand tour 
Its clumsiness as its own most damning censure 
Blasphemous and 
Gore for suspense . 
Shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling 
Should drop everything and run to ichi 
Gutsy

A fresh infusion 
Good , dry , reliable textbook 
Pitiful 
That throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary 
Expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time 
Getting a more mature body 
Hilarious dialogue 
Little revision works 
About an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth 
, the hours represents two of those well spent 
With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie 
, combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture 
Faked 
Predictable plotting 
It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior 
Story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material

Is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
Mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
Inelegant

Or `` suck '' 
Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
Succumbs to gravity and plummets

Comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited 
Provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . 
, sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that 
's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over 
That he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie 
Comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter 
Various amusing sidekicks 
Deeply out of place in what could have 
Director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood 
Be well worth your time 
Are sweet and believable , and 
Forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone

It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name .

Ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting 
All the sibling rivalry and 
The film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice 
His oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family 
Is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors 
You might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
Sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that 
Moving , and adventurous directorial debut 
Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .

Dangerous and domineering 
Too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style

Kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . 
A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it 
Slow pacing 
Crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction . 
Suits the script 
Are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
A remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie 
It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
A spiritual aspect 
An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie 
Try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . 
Spare but quietly effective retelling . 
Both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb 
One fantastic visual trope 
Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is 
A trend 
Sad but endearing

The amazing film work is so convincing that by movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
Dying for this kind of entertainment 
Flows as naturally 
I have to admit i walked out of runteldat . 
Queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
With cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names

Of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar 
Tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .

With an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , h��l��ne angel is definitely a director to watch .

In engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay 
A wooden delivery 
With superb performances throughout

Figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats 
`` real women have curves '' is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she 'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
To a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years

Invaluable historical document thanks 
The redeeming feature of chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine 
Even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player 
's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly 
Resembling humor 
Comes off like a hallmark commercial 
Of that special fishy community 
Clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . 
Throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue 
Talented and notorious subject 
The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
To find an old flame 
Gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
Come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another 
Ploddingly sociological 
A funny moment or 
The real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
An enthralling aesthetic experience 
The quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script . 
Topics that could make a sailor blush 
Heaven 
Proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery 
Do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are 
Filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another 
Readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
Never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence 
Its characters ' decisions 
Great pleasure 
Household name 
Is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , color and cringe . 
Credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
Has something interesting to say

The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all 
That warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women 
Has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
The film 's shortcomings 
's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do . 
Follows the formula , 
That if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise 
In a big corner office in hell 
Cute partnership 
Gets you riled up 
May be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all 
( jeff 's ) gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams 's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . 
Inadvertent 
Generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters 
Before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy 
Emptiness and 
Hokum but 
Worthless 
Of a paint-by-numbers picture

The off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
That he forgets to make it entertaining 
Watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
Has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment 
Like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome 
Far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
Must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans 
A movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling 
The kind of energy it 's documenting 
Nicolas cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , 
Sharper 
Has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , 
Wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller 
It 's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless 
Colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical ... 
Represents adam sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
The best actors 
Bad reviews 
Petter n?ss ' delicate , clever direction ... and a wonderful , imaginative script 
The charms 
Caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty 
Early work 
Ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling 
Their memorable and resourceful performances 
Into one terrific story with lots of laughs 
Steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas ' wounded and wounding uncle ralph 
Engrossing and grim 
It drowns in sap . 
Do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic 
Purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something 
The cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman 
Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .

Somber , absurd , 
Convey a tiny sense of hope 
May marginally enjoy the film 
Deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies 
Many ways the perfect festival film : 
A question for philosophers , not filmmakers 
Hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
With few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it 
Just how much more grueling and time-consuming 
To which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen 
With absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes 
Wizened 
It drags 
Throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh .

One of the worst movies of one year 
That never springs to life

Brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel 
, desiccated talent 
Mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress 
With the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
Sharp objects 
Are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal 
Will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then 
It 's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
Begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
The deliberate , tiresome ugliness 
A sterling ensemble cast 
They may be as history 
Guarantee 
We cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . 
Less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
The only problem 
Quite enough of them 
This is n't exactly profound cinema , but 
Will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one 
Asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in 
Comic set 
Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either . 
Is reasonably entertaining 
Left on a remote shelf 
Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and 
Deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell 
Such clarity 
've completely lowered your entertainment standards 
An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation 
Major waste 
Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
Like to ride bikes 
Sincere and artful 
A shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 
Soulful gravity 
Mindless without being the peak of all things insipid 
Is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
Better celebration 
Slick production values 
Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . 
Is fully formed and remarkably assured 
Line between passion and pretence . 
Undisputed scores a direct hit . 
People sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it 
To note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget 
Profound cinema 
In spite of its predictability 
Flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry 
Is sentimental 
Pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve 
Go but down 
Too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice 
A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about . 
Sets out 
Maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while

It 's hardly watchable 
One suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
Twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . 
A cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack 
Goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering 
Lilo & stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` mulan '' or `` tarzan 
'' is never lethargic 
Can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art 
Is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . 
All the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another 
Rousing , 
Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory 
Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
For children 
Very predictable 
Bad rock concert 
For those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed . 
Elaborate continuation 
Was a freshman fluke 
Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
Ill-fitting

Hated myself in the morning 
But darned if it does n't also keep us riveted to our seats . 
Seem so impersonal or even shallow 
The strength 
Just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
One very funny joke and

That it 's the butt of its own joke 
Drowned me in boredom 
To think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year 
Ambitious film 
Not remotely incisive enough 
's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . 
Terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project 
It does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .

Spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . 
Bad animation and mindless violence

A world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical 
` moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . ' 
A well-made pb & j sandwich 
Mediocre special effects

British stage icon 
Has a film 's title served such dire warning . 
That was n't at least watchable 
Lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants 
If this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
It 's icky . 
Has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope 
's a brazenly misguided project 
Character-driven storytelling 
Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . 
It 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy 
Trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge 
Can not engage . 
This is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
But no sense of pride or shame 
Like their characters 
Illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , 
Unsentimental 
Elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior 
An original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind 
Even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost do n't notice the 129-minute running time 
Is a tribute 
Comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness 
The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb 
Like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
It 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan 's unique directing style . 
Campanella 's competent direction 
Sparkling 
For its sheer audacity and openness 
Farce and blood-curdling family intensity 
That 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
Restrained and 
Entertaining british hybrid 
Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings 
The necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
A hoot 
Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .

They might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .

So unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar 
Is at 22 a powerful young actor 
Undermining the movie 's reality and 
Comedically labored 
A caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair 
Nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history 
The masses with star power , a pop-induced score 
Let-down 
The woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
Is all over the place , really . 
Well worth 
One film that 's truly deserving of its oscar nomination 
Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
Wiggling energy 
Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
Superb performances throughout 
Scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` gangs '' is never lethargic 
A worthwhile glimpse 
Is clever and funny , 
A fairly enjoyable mixture 
Takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point 
Unspeakably , unbearably dull 
Is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
Quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to 
Be madcap farce 
Most edgy 
An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
That is often quite rich and exciting 
Jackass 
Of being the big 
Pompous and garbled . 
Oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly 
Were a series of bible parables and not an actual story 
David letterman and the onion 
Its recent predecessor miserably 
The expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand 
To the otherwise bleak tale 
Spirit-crushing 
It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and 
Should please history fans 
The cast is appealing 
's awfully entertaining to watch 
As katzenberg 
Be invented to describe exactly how bad it is 
Little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
The transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull 
A more measured or polished production 
Worthy addition 
Deep into the girls ' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that 's opened between them 
Not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece 
Can be made 
The engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion . 
A powerful and deeply moving example 
Of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families 
Affirming and heartbreaking 
Crossing-over 
A surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood 's comic-book adaptations . 
Thud 
The plot ` surprises 
, self-indulgent and maddening 
This is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that 
Spellbinding fun 
Make the stones weep 
Flat-out amusing , 
Astonishing ... ( frames ) profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
From this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material 
Feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time 
'd live in if argento 's hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve 
Expected flair 
To his son 's home 
Itself is far from disappointing , offering an original 
's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . 
Talented , charismatic and tragically 
Can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music 
Would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's forget paris 
Is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
Dramatically forceful 
Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - 
Its heart 
Exceedingly clever 
He delivers fascinating psychological fare 
The ` wow ' factor 
Need n't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes ' work . 
Feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority 
A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but 
Be seen as hip , winking social commentary 
Make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool 
Have the patience for it 
Unfairly 
The problem 
Humor 
Keenly observed and refreshingly natural 
, that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
Undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
Just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
Gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
The worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy 
More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are 
Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i 'm not sure 
A fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side 
Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . 
Keen eye , sweet spirit 
Gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s.c. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
An overall sense of brusqueness 
With honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film 
Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; 
Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative 
It has fun with the quirks of family life 
Though it 's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and 
Do n't even like their characters . 
Suspenseful enough for older kids but 
Fascinating experiment 
Sleek and arty 
Most alive 
Probing or penetrating 
As the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
The wild wild west 
Seem like mere splashing around in the muck 
Whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one . 
Do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . 
Found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound 
Bittersweet 
Silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
Viscerally repellent 
Is a wonderful thing ; 
Semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
The concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . 
As-nasty - 
How well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering 
, two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
Your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door 
It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; 
Is n't just a poor fit with kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism 
Exuberantly 
Of poetry and passion 
Unlaughable 
It 's good enough to be the purr 
, dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
's exactly what these two people need to find each other 
This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
Plunging deeper 
To show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song 
What madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and 
Continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision 
An elegant visual sense and 
Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style 
Like a glossy rehash

Simplistic and more than a little pretentious

The bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , 
At once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge .

This dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u. ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips .

An extraordinary dramatic experience . 
Splendidly 
That they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans 
This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent 
The manner of a golden book sprung to life 
Striking a blow for artistic integrity 
Justifies its own existence 
On the strength of their own cleverness 
Vile 
Time out is as serious as a pink slip . 
Be any flatter 
Most immediate and most obvious pleasure 
A luis bu?uel film

Fussy 
Brutally dry 
Airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
Hideous 
Is almost an afterthought 
Medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt 
Feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
In the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears 
Pleasure to watch 
... begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot . 
French cinema at its best 
Whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply 
Insightful enough 
Lofty 
The film 's length becomes a part of its fun 
That offers no easy , comfortable resolution 
Film to drag on for nearly three hours 
With a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic 
Must have been lost in the translation 
Empty exercise 
Predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting 
Disjointed mess 
Emerges as powerful rather than cloying 
Atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation 
By an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out 
As the most offensive action 
All end

Give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once 
A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being 
Comes off winningly , 
Brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy 
On humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company 
Can admire 
Wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be 
, changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
A terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains 
Be numbing

An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .

Provocative and prescient 
We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .

Praises 
Of the ultimate scorsese film 
Fascinating , compelling story 
Physical energy 
A gift 
To a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
Make the film relevant today 
Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? 
As monumental as disney 's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs 
Cute moments 
Takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' 
Maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
Irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
-- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
Like their romances to have that french realism 
The basic plot of `` lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
Be two hours gained 
Humor and bite 
Are really going to love the piano teacher 
Growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body 
Is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . 
Of the worst movies of one year 
Miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity 
Grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion 
The everyday lives 
Dumbed-down approach 
Turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
Dynamism 
Coma-like state 
Feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful 
Cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
Vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm 
Sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
Vulgar 
Winning and wildly fascinating 
Is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
Waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this 
That , like shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough 
Portuguese master manoel de oliviera 
Banal and predictable 
That it 'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture 
Tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun 
On a pedestal 
To deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals 
God is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage 
Even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
A scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant ` videodrome . ' 
Strays 
Often pointless 
Setting off 
Desirable 
Of stale gags 
Is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc 's , 
Gutless 
Very complex 
An intriguing bit 
Shines like a lonely beacon 
, it 's the best sequel since the empire strikes back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
It lacks the detail of the book 
All movies 
See something that did n't talk down to them 
Explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor 
In the characters you see 
Huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women 's augustine 
Clarity and audacity 
Hanging 
From a fine cast 
` drumline ' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
People have lost the ability to think 
Frightening late fees 
Littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups 
's also somewhat clumsy 
Adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 
Lift 
( gulpilil ) is a commanding screen presence , 
The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
Kids to watch too many barney videos 
A fun family movie 
About friendship , love , and the truth 
All-powerful , 
Sweetly 
Stale copy 
Make paid in full worth seeing 
Is so often less 
Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
Its charm 
That the theme does n't drag an audience down 
They 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
That 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low 
Infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
Did the screenwriters just 
Still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
Some soul 
It 's loud and boring 
There 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair 
An essentially awkward version 
The chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy . 
Ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks 
Those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
The cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug 
A chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness . 
That both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , 
Purpose and finesse 
My enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold 
If you can push on through the slow spots 
Is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
There 's a heaven for bad movies 
Mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
Touchingly 
Been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit 
Maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity 
It 's a fantastic movie 
Achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
Big box office bucks 
Is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director 
The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count . 
Reeking of research library dust 
When a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic 
Proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
Brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans 
Of joy and energy 
Iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin 
Press the delete key 
, shoot-em-up scene 
Wonder of wonders -- 
The two leads , nearly perfect in their roles 
To be spectacularly outrageous 
Without lectures or confrontations 
Singing long after the credits roll 
Forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five 
The subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film 
The first half of sorority boys 
May be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg 's work . 
Is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
Honest and loving one 
Reveals itself slowly , 
Ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang 
Lucy liu never comes together 
That if the filmmakers just follow the books 
Hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) 
That burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory 
Offers an intriguing what-if premise . 
Human power 
That the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form 
Scenes and vistas and pretty moments 
A funny yet dark and seedy clash 
An unprecedented tragedy 
'll wait in vain for a movie to happen 
It 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year . 
Several scenes of this tacky nonsense 
Good-hearted 
The performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and 
As often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy 
Comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional 
Few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending 
A properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not 
's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer 
Is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative 
Message-mongering moralism 
A tawdry b-movie scum 
Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins . 
Colorful 
Casting call 
This fascinating -- and timely -- content 
A case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
Reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
Berling and b��art ... continue to impress , and 
Is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what ( evans ) had , lost , and got back 
Are so believable that you feel what they feel 
Is never satisfactory .

Incomprehensible 
With every cinematic tool

Their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful 
Mostly undeterminable 
Soap-opera quality twist 
Melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project 
Never inspired 
That this is n't something to be taken seriously 
See a devastating comic impersonation 
Some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid 
Kline 's superbly nuanced performance , 
Street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
Self-consciously poetic 
This remarkable and memorable film 
Love stories you will ever see . 
Deserves a sequel 
Surprisingly flat 
Celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , 
As the princess , sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . 
This is classic nowheresville in every sense 
She ca n't provide any conflict 
Is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten . 
Simple , sweet and romantic comedy 
A fascinating examination 
` the country bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation 
An impressive hybrid . 
Its relaxed , natural-seeming actors 
An insultingly inept and artificial examination 
Feels contrived , 
Like a cold old man going through the motions . 
Intriguing and honorable , 
That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
To forgive that still serious problem 
Minor-league soccer remake 
Humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence 
Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
Really a thriller 
Mush 
A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy 
The film 's problems 
A refreshingly forthright one 
An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
, hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character 's gripping humanity . 
A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans 
Painful and refreshing 
, the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
Gentle , unforced intimacy 
A bit of heart 
An alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs 
Being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
Like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
Belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers 
It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
Falling into the hollywood trap 
Well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie 
That the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be 
A group of extremely talented musicians 
Much more ordinary 
Through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse 
The ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity 
Cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
A painfully slow cliche-ridden film 
That finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful 
The precious trappings 
Director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films . 
, i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
Undistinguished 
Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
Natural-seeming actors 
Is unusual but unfortunately also irritating 
Of knucklehead swill 
Filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
Impeccable 
Cross between highlander and lolita 
's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films 
Burnt out on it 's a wonderful life marathons and bored 
Prefer to keep on watching 
Throwing up 
Offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them 
The enterprise 
, and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings 
Seen as hip , 
This charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love 
Wonderful but 
It ends up falling short as a whole 
Makes this film special 
Been better 
The story compelling 
Self-indulgent 
An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
Just plain dumb 
Sacrifices its promise 
Brisk delight 
Their surroundings 
Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and 
His ( nelson 's ) screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting 
It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
A thrill ride 
Shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers 
Dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace 
Of a good vampire tale 
Is his best film 
We just do n't really care too much about this love story . 
Polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
Kurys ' direction is clever and insightful 
Randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing 
Artificial 
, there 's no way you wo n't be talking about the film once you exit the theater . 
That one viewing ca n't possibly be enough 
At his most sparkling 
Chilling tale 
Italian freakshow 
Mordantly funny and 
... a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
The master of innuendo 
Firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action 
Deeply moving 
Can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in italian ) and you like ` masterpiece theatre ' type costumes 
Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
, tiresome nature 
Named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort 
Slow and ponderous , 
Will likely be nominated for an oscar next year 
A smashing success 
, well-developed characters 
Intriguing plot 
Sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care 
A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
Glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
With morality 
Groan and 
Makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen 
For fun-seeking summer audiences 
It may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied 
Smart and taut . 
To play one lewd scene after another 
The way this all works out 
Future years as an eloquent memorial 
Ratliff 's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , 
Its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism 
Swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises 
Does n't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love 
A film in which the talent is undeniable 
To care about the character 
The flowers of perversity , comedy and romance 
A lovely film ... elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic ... hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source 's complexity 
, it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part 
You 're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri 
Flawed support structure 
Strong themes of familial ties and 
Vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of 
Dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie 
To discover that tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus 
Weirdly likable 
Likely to witness in a movie theater for some time 
Intensely 
The movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized 
Its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups 
That 's pure entertainment 
's an unhappy situation all around 
That segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit 
It will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker 
Unparalleled proportions 
A perfect show 
These women 's 
And wai ka fai are ) sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests 
A strong thumbs up 
She 's a pretty woman ,

Better than ` shindler 's list '

Resonant gem 
A brutal 90-minute battle sequence 
The dull 
This tale has been told and retold ; 
Conniving wit 
Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
Smallness 
Passion , creativity , and fearlessness 
Give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions 
Most edgy piece 
Seems twice as long 
Revelatory about his psyche 
The slow parade of human frailty fascinates 
Spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : 
Distinguish one sci-fi work from another 
An epic of astonishing grandeur 
All sides 
Might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich�� has been unturned . 
Sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy 
To pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity 
Idealism 
Offers a guilt-free trip 
Violent , self-indulgent and maddening 
Paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller 
For but a few seconds 
Sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
The idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept 
With brutal honesty and respect for its audience 
You to accept it as life and go with its flow 
's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose 
Packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message 
Blood-curdling family intensity 
Shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain 
Outstanding soundtrack 
Limp biscuit 
Seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release 
Plays like a student film 
A flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire 
Noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
A great team 
Deeper every time 
Does not really 
Are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery 
Kooky and overeager 
The biggest problem i have 
's an unhappy situation all around . 
Drag as soon as the action speeds up 
A breath of fresh air now and then 
Fresh again 
Peerlessly 
A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant ` videodrome . ' 
This is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn 
Slopped ` em together here 
The perverse pleasure 
Makes the film special 
Just the labor involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light 
Punches 
Put away the guitar , sell the amp , and 
Dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated 
Really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions 
Does n't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
Independent-community 
's the inimitable diaz 
A great companion piece 
This fascinating look 
But something far more stylish and cerebral 
An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
It washed out despite all of that 
Illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
Terrifically entertaining specimen 
Emotionally and spiritually compelling journey 
Uneasy 
Have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama 
Reggio 's 
Gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s.c. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner 
Sex toys and offers 
Conceivable 
The film seems as deflated as he does 
Was a better film 
If it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor 
Even through its flaws , revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 
The gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy 
Its personable , amusing cast 
Pompous 
No excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish 
Of exceptional honesty 
Allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , 
Can be a knockout 
The extravagant confidence 
Intriguing and stylish 
An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures 
This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation . 
Is a depressing experience 
About 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity 
The project should have been made for the tube . 
Let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him 
Does n't add up to much 
Several old themes 
After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
Topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .

Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
A film that plays things so nice 
Sexual jealousy , resentment 
Technically sumptuous 
An invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker 's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
Self-determination 
A dentist 's waiting room 
At once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar 
Lacks the detail of the book 
And cinemantic flair 
Succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape 
's surprisingly decent , 
Elegant film 
Of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking 
If you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
From stark desert 
A good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 
Supremely good natured 
, marvelously twisted shapes history 
Digitally altered footage 
Big stars and high production values

More than anything else slight ... tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations 
Milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title 
Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
Is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , 
Induce sleep 
Uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year . 
, it would fit chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special . 
Flat

Because it 's lousy 
A characteristically engorged and sloppy 
Wastes its time 
You there is no sense 
's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
That 's superficial and unrealized 
A negligible work 
Though the film is well-intentioned 
The kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more 
The usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably 
A lovely film ... elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic 
Laughing at his own joke 
Does n't reach them 
The overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr. mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
Can depress you about life itself 
You put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school 
Extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles 
's a very very strong `` b + 
Spirit 
Short and sweet 
It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message 
Comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
The film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant 
Is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . 
Swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes 
Everything that 's good 
The boozy self-indulgence 
, it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
Fears 
Left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments 
It makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones 's diary 
Using his storytelling ability 
Wishy-washy 
Remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks 
Picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
Cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle 
's tremendously moving 
Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but 
, you can feel the love . 
Surprisingly juvenile 
Land beyond time 
A weak and ineffective ghost story 
'd take ( its ) earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time 
're - doing-it-for - the-cash 
Of too many story lines 
A joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate 
( n ) o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
Exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do n't have , and how this gets us in trouble 
Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .

The day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it 
A submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural 
Once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent 
This story about love and culture 
One of the best silly horror movies of recent memory 
Sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
More dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition 
Which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance 
Probably the best case for christianity 
Best part ' 
It is a whole lot of fun and 
, my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , color and cringe . 
An astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline 
Serious critique 
Is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer . 
The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
Of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years 
Any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out 
For most movies , 84 minutes is short

Achieving some honest insight 
So fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated .

I found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 
Nothing happens

Moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior 
Fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides . 
In a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span

About 25 minutes of decent material 
For devotees of french cinema 
We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 
Predictable outcome 
Borrows a bit from the classics `` wait until dark '' and `` extremities '' ... but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself

Plaintiveness 
Just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ... a true study , a film with a questioning heart 
Generate a lot of energy 
Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
Sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history 
Put hairs on your chest

Open-hearted film 
Look so bad in a major movie 
Sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst 
Jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery 
Odd , inexplicable and unpleasant

Lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food 
As the treat of the title 
Like a splendid meal 
Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least . 
... the reason to go see `` blue crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
Allows us to chuckle through the angst 
Is a great deal of fun 
Odd purity 
Which is good news to anyone who 's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films 
Gorgeous exterior photography 
A good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
Knucklehead 
Intelligent high school 
Dashing and resourceful hero 
Do you 
To surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving 
A dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater 
'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
Gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny 
I ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ... 
Find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; 
Comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , 
Can truly be 
Is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
The funniest person 
Just fine 
Be lost on the target audience 
Quite entertaining 
Thrills , too many flashbacks 
Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
Punchy dialogue 
The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
Michael myers for good 
From a consummate actor incapable of being boring 
Go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid 
, provocative and vainglorious 
Flounders under the weight of too many story lines 
Miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
Ringside seat 
Start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
Gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful 
They have been patiently waiting for 
, the film never recovers from the clumsy clich�� of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms. paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
A story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation 
To boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other 
Adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong 
Aching 
Tear-drenched 
Often shocking but ultimately worthwhile 
Most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; `` frailty '' leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
This remake of lina wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
It is n't entirely persuasive 
Mesmerised

Further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap

Plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter 
Take before indigestion sets 
To keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film 
Steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas ' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . 
Nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
Ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favor of an altogether darker side 
Rosenthal ( halloween ii )

What should have been a painless time-killer 
Stirring road movie . 
Rather brilliant little cult item 
From any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
Is just such an achievement . 
Resonant

In heaven 
Albeit a visually compelling one , 
All the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head 
The most original in years

Big mistake .

Make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs . 
Overlong 
... pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .

Excellent performances 
Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises 
, the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
Like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy 
Above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm

That rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is 
It falls into the trap of pretention almost every time 
Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .

The film is all over the place , really . 
Kapur 's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
Puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally could n't care less 
Properly spooky 
One problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
Has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
To do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases 
Will have a showdown 
, the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
Whimsicality 
Is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
An excellent companion piece 
Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
Finest non-bondish performance 
However , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
Observations on the human condition 
Stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 
Underrehearsed 
The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste 
Expressing itself in every way imaginable 
The redeeming feature of chan 's films has always been the action 
Slow-moving 
All-over-the-map 
For the most part wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and 
The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and 
A fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating 
Incredibly irritating 
It 's like an all-star salute to disney 's cheesy commercialism . 
Funniest american comedy 
Delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed 
Schiffer 
The film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original , but one ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters 
It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure 
Most multilayered and sympathetic 
Family comedy 
Is a failure 
The script and characters hold sway 
Is ultimately quite unengaging 
Is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
That recalls the classics of early italian neorealism 
That it does n't give a damn 
Nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia 
Does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
Little jokes 
So impersonal or even shallow 
The insinuation of mediocre acting or 
True to its animatronic roots 
If you can get past the taboo subject matter 
Speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life . 
Negligible 
Some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) 
Muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters 
Unfocused and 
More enjoyable 
Other than the slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , everything else is top shelf . 
Is intriguing , provocative stuff 
Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is . 
Irresistible , languid romanticism 
The worst of tragedies 
Incredibly captivating 
's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken 
But blatantly biased . 
Simple , poignant and leavened with humor 
Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
-- conrad l. hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
A wholesome fantasy 
The best war movies ever made 
Irredeemably awful 
The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point 
Pray does n't have a passion for the material . 
The incredible storyline 
Smartly 
Victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and 
What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity 
... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 
Intoxicating show 
Mainstream audiences have rarely seen 
Diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack 
300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
Like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars 
Several uninteresting , unlikeable people 
Into hokum 
For juicy roles 
That the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus 
The film above anything sandler 's been attached to before 
Loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel 
( p ) artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . 
What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
The story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film 
Insanely violent 
There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . 
Its many excesses 
For a fairly inexperienced filmmaker 
Freshness and 
Of promise 
No denying the power of polanski 's film 
More sheerly beautiful film

Coordinated 
Estranged 
To being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing 
It works superbly here 
No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting 
A wonder 
The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th heaven . '' 
Returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power 
The precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story 
Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
Exercise in style and mystification 
Violent and 
Would be very sweet indeed 
Visually striking and viscerally repellent 
Entirely suspenseful 
The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid 
And narrative strength 
Threefold expansion 
Gracious , eloquent film 
Is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way 
Is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films . 
Helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying 
J. lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl 
Enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , 
A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains ... crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
Being gullible 
, insightful and entertaining 
Generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again 
On a high note 
Is a verbal duel between two gifted performers 
Bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama 
To see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' 
The beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself 
Unfilmable '' novels 
If not a home run , then at least a solid base hit .

Better movie 
An artistry that also smacks of revelation 
Charismatic charmer 
Covered earlier and much better 
Does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
Fest that 'll put hairs on your chest 
The lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect 
That are as valid today 
Kids-cute 
This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
Funny and touching film 
's sweet and fluffy at the time 
Had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
Of international acclaim 
Any dummies guide , something 
A family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life .

Fun-seeking

Expert thriller 
A painless time-killer 
To vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends 
It 's still not a good movie

A genre-curling crime story 
This is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving 
Constantly touching , surprisingly funny , 
Period-piece movie-of-the-week 
Musical passion 
Its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances 
An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art 
I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and 
That it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime 
About the human need for monsters to blame for all that

True love 
There are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but 
The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
Does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject -- taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history 
A supremely kittenish performance 
It might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience 
's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle 
Like a lazy summer afternoon 
Pretty good execution 
Appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics )

Lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest 
Deft sense 
Are terribly wasted 
Is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
Who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil 
Light , fun cheese puff 
Is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth

Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film 
A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .

Amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings 
Keeps you guessing at almost every turn 
A lame kiddie flick 
An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema 
None of this is meaningful or memorable , 
An utterly incompetent conclusion

Too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if . ''

Have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow 
Ultimately defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second 
Like a skillful fisher 
The film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes 
The problems and characters it reveals 
Is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period . 
The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film 's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy 
An exercise in chilling style 
Cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
Underdog movie since the bad news bears 
If you 're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film .

A captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
A glorified sitcom , 
Some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok 
Drags the film down

A strong narrative 
About this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller 
Assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties

Bad of a movie 
Saucy

Offbeat humor , amusing characters 
Ridiculous dialog 
No good inside dope , and 
Beautifully crafted and brutally honest 
Do n't have a clue on the park

Gooeyness 
Walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible 
An empty exercise , 
Totally overwrought 
Above the ordinary 
Tries and tries hard 
In a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow 
Reliable 
Quirky , original 
The storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
Strikes a very resonant chord 
But tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and parker 's creative interference ...

We had to endure last summer , and 
Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , i 'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl 
If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot . 
In some terrific setpieces 
Could relish

Be shaking your head all the way to the credits 
Consistently clever and suspenseful

Amazingly dopey

Reveals how bad an actress she is 
A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .

Vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends 
The performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
Will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
Lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature 
Hard ground 
Has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and 
Is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
Terms with his picture-perfect life 
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; 
Is not only a pianist , but a good human being

Imagine benigni 's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial 
During the long build-up of expository material 
Was at least funny 
That fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of 
Its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
Delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
Amusing and 
Overrun 
Well shot 
Sense-of-humour 
This thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing 
Exciting moviemaking 
, offensive and redundant 
Rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
It also treats the subject with fondness and respect 
The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
Various victimized audience members 
You may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg 's work . 
That works . 
Animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world

Cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , 
A remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point 
A fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh 
Cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) ,

She lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground 
A low-rent retread of the alien 
's great cinematic polemic 
Littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
( soderbergh ) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness 
Makes it a comic book with soul 
It accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people

Lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground 
Any stylish sizzle

With a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .

Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . 
A mostly magnificent directorial career 
Imperfect

Promising cast 
Overflows with wisdom and emotion . 
A surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past

The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
Why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera 
As a surprisingly anemic disappointment 
Who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture 
It 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
Adam sandler assault 
Refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy 
, the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
The limits of what a film can be , 
Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff . 
The real masterpiece 
Do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ?

A remarkable new trick 
Leaves a lot to be desired . 
That tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus 
Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever 
But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
A mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex 
Skins has a desolate air 
An art 
Great cast 
Feels uncomfortably real 
Reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness 
`` extreme ops '' exceeds expectations . 
Good fight 
Kind of an authentic feel 
Daft by half ... but supremely good natured . 
Does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift 
That gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
Entertains 
's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
Scary-funny 
Favorite 
Dreadful romance . 
So engagingly 
That it counts heart as important as humor 
Bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
Sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach 
Is smarter and subtler than ( total recall and blade runner ) ,

One of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead . 
To guilt-trip parents

A wannabe comedy 
With the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america 's winter movie screens it 's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
Would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility 
Crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy

Has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end 
A huge cut of above the rest 
The plot almost arbitrary 
Delightfully charming 
Of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions 
Also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
Awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude 
This one is a few bits funnier than malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
Fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
Will likely prefer to keep on watching . 
Unclear 
Getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable 
Expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street 
Has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
Routine crime

The film never recovers from the clumsy clich�� of the ugly american abroad 
Usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails

Was n't just bad 
The director is a magician 
Sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen

Awesome work :

Caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater 
It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and 
Stay with the stage versions , however , 
It has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults 
Was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive 
Of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized

Many a hollywood romance 
Immense imax screen 
Infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own 
In an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids 
Directed with purpose and finesse by england 's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing 
The summer 's most pleasurable movies 
Tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , 
Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares 
This method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here . 
Road movie , coming-of-age story and 
Eee for excitement 
See a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' 
Might have required genuine acting from ms. spears 
The filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story

Is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami 's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics

Fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of 
Of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents 
None of this is very original 
Several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is 
Preposterous , prurient whodunit 
As hilarious 
Does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
To show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen 
Wonderfully lush 
, sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
Were wonderful 
Twenty years after its first release , e.t. remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg 's misunderstood career . 
Makes a better short story

Unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it 
The film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience

Fun and funny in the middle , 
Take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride . 
Were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities

You can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood is n't going to jell . 
Dull , lifeless , and irritating 
Garc��a bernal and talanc��n are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you 'll want things to work out . 
Dark places 
A very depressing movie of many 
It is very difficult to care about the character , and 
Built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
Is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home 
Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
Struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and 
A uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
Sincerely 
Can you take before indigestion sets in 
Crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings . 
Somnambulant exercise 
Is destined to be the 21st century 's new `` conan '' and that he 's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal . 
It summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle 
Family fun 
White oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that does n't mean you wo n't like looking at it . 
Are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook 
Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it

Of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the ( teen comedy )

None of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
Squeeze a few laughs 
Of a sick and evil woman 
Diverse and astonishingly articulate 
In his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality 
Did i miss something 
Rather unbelievable 
If you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
Is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie 
Some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school 
Cheery and tranquil suburban life 
Weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
With a zippy jazzy score 
Very interesting 
Nice change

Cheered 
Undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering 
As that sentiment 
Restrictive and chaotic 
Is a failure . 
Candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars 
Is rote work and predictable 
While insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan 's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
Scored and powered 
A dreary , humorless soap opera 
Ability to make its subject interesting to those who are n't part of its supposed target audience 
Glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat 
A terrible strength 
Have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant 
Straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
The same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors 
Realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already 
Chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department . 
Of epic scale 
, the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
There is little else to recommend `` never again . '' 
You 'll love this movie . 
Sheer joy and pride 
Inspires 
Is perfectly creepy and believable . 
An already obscure demographic 
Is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams 
A paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and

The precision of the insurance actuary 
Deserving 
Turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny 
The one-sided theme 
Is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins 
A minor miracle of self-expression 
Of hackery 
Hack script 
Has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange 
Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
Like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable 
A retread story 
Sense-of-humour failure 
Blaxploitation spoof 
Bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .

Layered 
Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u.s. -- 
Splashy and 
Thoroughly formulaic film 
Her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , 
Cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , 
Goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots 
Will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers 
With a smile that says , ` if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master 
Suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
With spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count 
Others do n't , 
Humble , teach and 
Never once predictable 
Increasingly amused 
Too-frosty exterior 
Jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette 
By an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances 
Few cheap shocks 
Still charming 
The formula is familiar but enjoyable . 
Quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation 
Lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho . 
It seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is 
Feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy 
Insulted 
Men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance 
's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy 
It will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker . 
The movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain 
My mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
Swooning melodrama 
Stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable 
Make a clear point 
Fertile 
Energetic and sweetly whimsical 
But no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history 
Playful but highly studied and 
It 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime 
The river 
Laudable 
This overproduced piece of dreck 
There is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . 
A keep - 'em - guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters

Tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise 
Going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
Faux-urban 
's most memorable about circuit 
Feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs 
Audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , 
Semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out `` when you 're a jet 
Its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story . 
, all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor . 
A few gross-out comedies i 've been trying to forget 
Reassuring 
With the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte 's web of desire and desperation 
Very talented but underutilized 
Extraordinary journalism 
Works more often than it does n't 
Skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation 
With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , ( crane ) becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report 
A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products ... 
It 's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . 
Good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart 
Foul-mouthed 
Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
The tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned 
Particularly amateurish episode 
Failed jokes , 
Downward 
's tough to watch 
Tragedies 
A smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search 
As with all ambitious films , it has some problems 
A frustrating patchwork 
Like those d.w. griffith made in the early days of silent film 
Cheap , ludicrous attempt 
Deftly executed 
Hugh grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
Not even solondz 's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
Chance to shine 
To be somebody , and 
Is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls 
Would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
Sexual relationship 
Of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy 
For the film 's winning tone 
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
The enjoyable undercover brother 
Is felt ; not the craven of ' a nightmare on elm street ' or ` the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` deadly friend 
Rant 
Is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live 
Has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
Inactive 
Worst films 
Ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time 
, they ca n't go wrong . 
The film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong . 
The big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
' the play more has partly closed it down . 
, nonsensical and formulaic 
Sexy beast 
, we need agile performers 
Entertainingly 
Tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian 
The brawn , but not the brains 
This might have been an eerie thriller 
Solidly 
A farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher 
Plays out ... like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller 's time out . 
's burns ' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
's a bargain-basement european pickup . 
Inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage 
Conned 
It 's kinda dumb . 
Video , and 
Beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade 
User-friendly 
The performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe 
A very distinctive sensibility , 
A movie as artificial and soulless 
Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and 
Us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer 
Its predecessors proud 
By mediocrity 
Keep it entertaining 
Is ) the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i 'm just about ready to go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike 
's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
Done and perfectly 
The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , 
They do in this marvelous film 
Is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time 
Feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story 
The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic . 
Rape-payback 
Of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion 
A weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment 
Is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
, murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock 's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
Jiang wen 's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
Like a drunken driver 
... unbearably lame . 
Now it is a copy of a copy of a copy 
The underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese 's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . 
Are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations 
Brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life 's harshness . 
Less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates 
Of hope 
Is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame . 
This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie i 've seen this summer 
A wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 's quest to find an old flame . 
A raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast 
Is , by itself , deserving of discussion 
Gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
Tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down . 
An accessible introduction 
, but far more witty 
This wedding 
Exceptional honesty 
Is more than a movie . 
Too many 
Ugly-duckling 
A fine job of updating white 's dry wit to a new age 
Mostly repetitive 
The big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest 
The director 's many dodges and turns 
The anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack 
None of which ever seem to hit 
While thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances 
Are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , 
Handily 
It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
Dutifully pulling on heartstrings 
( kline 's ) utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , 
An oscar-worthy performance 
The bland songs 
Succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
Kind of special 
That 's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary 
Rush to the theater 
End all chases 
A fan 
Be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid 
All its strange quirks 
Have failed 
Proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings 
Director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
Had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear 
's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
Is , in a word , brilliant 
's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
Well 
Most damning 
Force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover 
That the material is so second-rate 
By the time the credits roll across the pat ending 
Serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool 
Trapped and 
Enjoyed it just as much ! 
Tale 
In any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's forget paris . 
Would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
Elicits strong performances 
Good qualities 
Paranoia 
Mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering 
In this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called ` the gift of tears 
His life , his dignity and his music 
Looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise 
Disconcertingly 
Mel 
Realism , crisp storytelling 
Supposed to feel funny and light 
Scare 
Seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference 
Catches dramatic fire 
Recycling 
Broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
You feel like running out screaming 
With a sharp script and strong performances 
-- and not in a good way 
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better . 
Sneaks up on the viewer 
Gasp 
Do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? 
Decorous 
Gets vivid performances 
As my friend david cross would call it , ` hungry-man portions of bad ' 
A dashing and absorbing 
That a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen 
A buoyant , expressive flow 
Such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and 
The plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream 
By storm 
, it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
, violent , self-indulgent and maddening 
, payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 
No such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . 
To the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama 
Assured in its execution 
A terrible movie 
Illuminated 
Poignant if familiar story of a young person 
Homogenized and a bit contrived 
The rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people 
Is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it 
Producer john penotti 
Is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up 
Smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams

Fast-paced 
Of a film that does n't know what it wants to be 
The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched

A powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man 's dying fall . 
There are entertaining and audacious moments

About sorority boys 
Feels like a book report 
Dull , inconsistent , dishonest 
Neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy 
The most accomplished work 
This rush to profits 
To watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
The masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental

But ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
They show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks 
The work of a genuine and singular artist

Really good premise 
Of a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone 
Just is n't worth telling 
Never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
By the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails 
You know there 's something there .

Promising debut 
Heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
By the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat 
Stunning film 
A quaint , romanticized rendering . 
That leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature 
Potty-mouthed 
Listless sci-fi comedy 
Combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why did n't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
Comic voice 
With strange and wonderful creatures 
The kind of ` laugh therapy ' i need from movie comedies 
That there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally

The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .

Elegantly produced and expressively performed 
Recovering from its demented premise 
Best about 
That stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 
Determined , ennui-hobbled slog 
Dogged 
The film has a terrific look 
The movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clich��d and too often strains credulity . 
A comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration 
's certainly laudable 
How they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made 
Hot and the john wayne classics

This is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd 
Harmoniously 
A mere excuse 
Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
Less-than-thrilling thriller . 
Beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama 
The slippery slope 
An uncompromising film 
Sinuously plotted and 
But a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination 
Flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny 
But , like silence , it 's a movie that gets under your skin . 
The original was n't a good movie but 
Contrived , nonsensical and formulaic 
A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
Irritating soul-searching garbage .

's a lot to recommend read my lips 
In lovely and amazing 
The film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
Cranky 
Like the hours as an alternative 
Without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision 
Alarms for duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks 
Of a minor miracle in unfaithful 
Sing beautifully and 
There 's an enthusiastic charm in fire that makes the formula fresh again 
All the queen 's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
A capable thriller 
He is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' ( 1999 ) and ` analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year

A fascinating film 
, it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds 
Terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its ��lan , humor , bile , and irony

The characters are so generic 
Genial but never inspired , and little

Thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film 
Some of the funniest jokes of any movie 
Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
Simpering soundtrack

Operates nicely 
In this simple , sweet and romantic comedy

Best possible 
Is good news to anyone who 's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films 
I liked the movie 
Ongoing - and unprecedented - 
Out to be 
Has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
Most certainly has a new career ahead of him 
It 's this rich and luscious 
A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive . 
Compelling storyline 
Serenity and poise 
Liberal doses 
A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
The lord of the rings 
Miss it 
Incisive and 
Green is ) the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i 'm just about ready to go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
To infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor 
Good simmer 
If considerably less ambitious 
A frightening and compelling 
It 's as comprehensible as any dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy . 
Hot 
Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun . 
Bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera 
It will probably be a talky bore . 
Glamorous 
, a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails 
More fascinating -- being real -- 
Undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective 
Surprisingly powerful and universal 
A refreshing change 
One viewing ca n't possibly be enough 
This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... 
Good-natured ensemble comedy 
, salvation and good intentions 
Can prevent its tragic waste of life 
By bad writing 
Rock-solid gangster movie 
Are so unmemorable 
Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs 
Something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans 
A guiltless film for nice evening out 
, tortured 
Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful . 
All its brilliant touches 
A tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
Despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
Vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
Clarity and emotional 
A convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness 
Ozpetek 's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
Loosely connected characters and 
That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film 
Shallow 
Sweeping , dramatic , 
Fabulous 
I recommend it for its originality alone 
Occasionally very enjoyable 
Enlightening 
Opens today in the new york metropolitan area 
A downer and 
A joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to 
Of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing 
Set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to 
An artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form 
Jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m��tier 
Is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
Alienate the mainstream audience 
Fragmentary 
An honestly nice little film 
Its own quirky hipness 
Snore 
Is a big , juicy role 
The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul 's perspective . 
Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
, stay away . 
This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
Direction and especially charm 
A troubled and determined homicide cop 
Is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days 
Down a familiar road with a few twists 
Some laughs and 
Do n't deserve any oscars 
Into the art film pantheon 
Unexceptional 
Feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again 
, the humor wry and sprightly 
The otherwise good-naturedness of mr. deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos 
A wild ride 
Revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate 
Has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year 
As giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago . 
It has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
Be even worse than its title 
A triumph 
Is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie 
The characters are based on stock clich��s , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
Takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
Thoroughly unrewarding all of this 
It 's simply baffling 
Throws in enough clever and unexpected 
While it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
Intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business 
See scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
Bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams 
Nothing but boilerplate clich��s from start to finish 
No way to entertain or inspire its viewers 
As its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care 
An amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination 
Ocean visuals 
The story 's undeniably hard to follow 
Copycat 
Were an obligation 
Christian 
Be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service 
An old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
Is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
The imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light 
It would n't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway 
Be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show 
Heart-felt drama 
One strike against it 
Does have its charms 
Payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he 's the best brush in the business 
The earnestness 
Prominent 
Is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , color and cringe 
Sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans 
Exasperated 
Caliber cast 
Weirdly 
Reality-snubbing 
The french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama 
Walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like 
Enthusiastically 
By the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor 
A welcome step 
Foolish 
Reasonably good 
A certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting 
... a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life 's endgame . 
Love it ... 
One of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies 
Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards 
To screen with considerable appeal intact 
It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it 
Incoherent , instantly disposable 
The worst kind of mythologizing 
's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . 
Short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child 's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty . 
For the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg 
The unusual power 
A pleasing , often-funny comedy . 
A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet 
Exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest 
Beer-fueled 
Rates as an exceptional thriller 
Poetic 
This is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
Has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style 
Dullingly 
It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling 
That anyone in his right mind would want to see the it 
Occasionally fun 
One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? 
Could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one 
Got the brawn , but not the brains 
Sordid and 
Than to call attention to themselves 
An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
Move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona 
Clich��-laden 
Risky 
Cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness 
Will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime 
It 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it 
Lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness 
The cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s 
As predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre 
Knows its classical music , 
Little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets 
Between sullivan and his son 
If frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director 
A pianist , but a good human being 
Bland 
The direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority 
Inappropriate and wildly undeserved 
Actor michel serrault 
The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , 
Adult world 
Starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni 
Was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star 
Is the kathie lee gifford of film directors 
Is worth seeing 
Delicious and delicately 
's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening . 
To cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
Much of it is funny , but 
Absurdly simplistic 
Will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere 
Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , i ca n't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . 
Worthwhile addition 
Sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 
Will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget . 
So much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost 
Star-power potential 
Ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
It definitely gives you something to chew on 
Annoyance 
The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they 'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
Redolent 
Acute writing 
So larger than life 
In anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year 
Good-naturedly 
Running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often 
An important movie , or even 
Oh , look at that clever angle ! 
Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast 
Wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse . 
In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs. sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
Should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it 
Feel like time fillers between surf shots . 
Inconceivable 
Is deadly 
Current innovators 
It will stay with you 
Powerful performance 
Peter mattei 's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note 
Poor editing , 
Of one of the best films 
The ridicule factor 
Nutty , consistently funny . 
Friday after next spreads them pretty thin 
Furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation 
This cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story 
It finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
Satisfying well-made romantic comedy 
The lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and 
Feeling refreshed and hopeful 
While delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage 
To be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general 
We 'll keep watching the skies for his next project 
Well-thought 
Go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
Time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference 
A giddy and provocative sexual 
Drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
Woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken 
Attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and 
Woe-is-me 
's definitely an improvement on the first blade , 
Reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth 
Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span 
A sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . 
Made the full monty a smashing success ... but 
The movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
The german occupation 
Of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i 've had in a while 
You have an interest in the characters you see 
To sneak out of the theater 
's hard not to be carried away 
The cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries 
Is n't very good 
Reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today 
Witty and often surprising 
Building up to the climactic burst of violence 
The first part making up for any flaws that come later 
All the verbal marks it should 
Should give `` scratch '' a second look 
Of laughs 
Are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing 
For those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent 
Quick-buck 
Her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance 
Give a spark to `` chasing amy '' and `` changing lanes '' falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` the sum of all fears 
Jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour 
Be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something 
Impeccable throughout 
Murderer 
A knockout 
Is rote work and predictable , 
Vibrance and warmth 
Dull with only caine 
No . 
On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint . 
To the bitter end 
The chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes 
A few are sexy 
This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton 's ever-watchful gaze -- and it 's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
Veers into corny sentimentality , probably 
'll still have a good time . 
The film 's lamer instincts 
Is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation . 
Strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
Cute 
Interesting concept 
Signs is a tribute to shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
A great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax 
The wonderful cinematography and 
In the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality 
Most incoherent 
An often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . 
The remarkable ensemble cast 
Darkness 
A great script 
Is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
Is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does 
So vividly that the artist 's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film 
A raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up 's i 'm the one that i want . 
A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
Telling what at heart is a sweet little girl 
Acts like a doofus 
Is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
Stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere 
Every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics 
You expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
That made the original men in black such a pleasure 
Intelligent 
Film festival 
Had to sit through it again 
Gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion 
Stretches of impact and moments 
Children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers 
It is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
Great to begin with 
More than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach 
Just a kiss is a just a waste . 
May well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy 
Uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious 
Observant . 
It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
Depressingly thin 
Good fun 
Never gets off the ground . 
Bring on the sequel 
Unendurable viewing experience 
Gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here 
Makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish 
Redeems it 
Surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
See this , the final part of the ` qatsi ' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music 
Has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood 
Ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending 
To examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative 
Lame kiddie flick 
Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... well 
... there is enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
Vowing , 
Is too long with too little 
Makes its message resonate . 
Stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe . 
The film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans . 
Slow death 
As much fun 
Very real and amusing give-and-take 
Makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
Kinda dumb 
For touched by an angel simplicity 
The sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic 
Its engaging simplicity 
Is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply 
, worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it 
The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
At female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor 
Sabotaged by pomposity 
A part of its fun 
Drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
Once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny 
Coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching 
Magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch 
Deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion 
Filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love 
And vulgar innuendo 
Enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch 
Undeniably touched 
Racial insensitivity 
Only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department 
Sexy razzle-dazzle 
To the film 's considerable charm 
Stuffiest 
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours 
Surprisingly ` solid ' 
Clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment 
An airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 
We 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport 
Has succeeded beyond all expectation 
Of a really solid woody allen film 
Is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
Both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement 
That should be relegated to a dark video store corner 
In good fun 
Almost perpetually wasted characters 
Brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing 
Family audience 
More mature than fatal attraction 
Go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving 
A perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
Now as a former gong show addict , i 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
Should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
An obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera 
Into hogwash 
That beneath the familiar , funny surface 
Sparse instances 
Captivating and intimate 
Broad streaks of common sense 
Resourceful amnesiac 
's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
Directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
That the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 
An unflinching look 
It has made its way into your very bloodstream 
Enjoy its own transparency 
Vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace 
An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
Always destined to be measured against anthony asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
Nothing original 
The solid filmmaking and 
And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
An interesting racial tension 
It falls far short of poetry , but 
Makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work 
The outstanding thrillers 
The unexplored story opportunities 
Chance to see three splendid actors 
Marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks 
Disguising the obvious with energy and innovation 
Presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 
A degree of affection rather than revulsion 
Sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer 
For overstimulated minds 
's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces 
Dramatic nor comic 
Dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances 
Are often a stitch 
As ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design 
Screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy 
A dull girl 
Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river 
In mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested 
Of nature and family warmth 
` cherish ' 
've seen before 
Strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends 
For history buffs 
Sleeper 
A grittily beautiful film 
Is a trove of delights . 
This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . 
A sexy , surprising romance ... idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
Creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
It were that grand a failure 
That rare movie that works on any number of levels 
Spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb 
Nourishing aspects 
Pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste 
Go-for-broke 
Are n't very bright 
To generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal 
's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative 
It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
Are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine 
Its own good 
Few sequels 
Wedding sequence 
Who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes 
Uni-dimensional 
Who know nothing about the subject 
A clear point 
Singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece 
Leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach 
Collapses like an overcooked souffl�� . 
To the world trade center tragedy 
Brings them to life 
Oddly compelling 
Compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject 
Enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school 
Sweet home alabama is n't going to win any academy awards , but 
Self-righteousness 
Lives down to its title . 
Have lost the ability to think 
, reverent , and subtly different 
With an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt 
To drown yourself in a lake afterwards 
Safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
Will grab you 
It also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
Has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream 
... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
Deeply out of place 
A low rate annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school 
Projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless 
'll enjoy the hot chick . 
Stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , 
The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
Are too grave for youngsters 
Right movie 
A documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it 
Old , familiar 
As inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
The good and different 
, this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
A vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition . 
, it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . ' 
-- ever so gracefully -- 
The too-frosty exterior 
To being exciting 
Pleasant enough 
Some good , organic character work 
A twisted sense 
The movie is well crafted , and well executed . 
's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
... keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 
Deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later 
A full experience 
Better actor 
Painful 
Making `` die another day '' one of the most entertaining bonds in years 
The crap continues . 
The grandness of romance 
To watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
, it should pay reparations to viewers . 
Overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
Passionate heart 
Unfunny and 
Of honest poetry 
... an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
Bad filmmaking 
Their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop 
Too heady for children , and too preachy 
Of the ugly american 
Clearly evident quality 
That would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel 
Perfectly pleasant if 
Where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical 
Of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been 
Best brush 
Unrealistic 
This is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
To overcome gaps in character development and story logic 
Overmanipulative 
Makes you care about music you may not have heard before 
Nicest 
Good movie 
Me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens 
Are nearly impossible to care about 
Suited for the history or biography channel 
Just like a splendid meal 
The action sequences -- clearly the main event -- 
, color and cringe 
The problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
Deflated ending aside , there 's much to recommend the film . 
A haunting tale 
Sillier 
Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... 
Awards animals the respect they 
By a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment 
That even freeman ca n't save it 
Is the film roman polanski may have been born to make . 
The visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza 
In the present 
Immensely appealing 
In death to smoochy , we do n't get williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
Well-lensed 
A riveting story well told . 
Cardiac arrest 
If invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski 
His own idiosyncratic strain 
That does the nearly impossible 
Gorgeous 
Of pre-9 / 11 new york and 
Greatest teacher 
Low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- 
Gripping 
Ca n't say it 's on par with the first one 
Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
Execrable 
Destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
Sweet and romantic 
Most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme 
Is hugely overwritten , 
A bad soap opera 
Unflappable air 
As endearing and easy 
With no signs of life 
A rollicking adventure for you and 
A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai 's vaunted empathy . 
Quite fun 
Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . 
, satisfying 
To be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen 
Sticks rigidly to the paradigm , 
The director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop 
Painful ride 
Less funny 
Solid 
We had to endure last summer 
Fascinate in their recklessness 
Davis 
The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable 
A kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside 
's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance 
Remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops 
Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... 
There 's an admirable rigor to jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down 
Those famous moments 
That it appears not to have been edited at all 
's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager 
An emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine 
Achievement 
If you can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in italian ) and you like ` masterpiece theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie . 
A sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect . 
All works out 
Espn 
A winner 
Usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography 
Was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
You do n't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that 's the mark of a documentary that works . 
If you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood 
Lane and 
Are terribly wasted . 
Makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way 
A rich historical subject 
Deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history 
Makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly 
A blast of adrenalin 
Poor 
... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus 
Have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release 
Wit and humor 
Does so without compromising that complexity . 
's splash without the jokes . 
For bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension 
Least favorite 
For words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life 
Bizarre , implausible 
The last kiss 
Length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue 
In bad filmmaking 
Campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
Has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
Worth the trip to the theater 
It simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
Loud , brash and mainly unfunny 
Sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated 
Are anguished , bitter and truthful 
Low , smoky and inviting 
, transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision 
Is particularly impressive . 
Screenplay or 
A solidly entertaining little film . 
Lazy ,

Predictable plotting and 
The color sense of stuart little 2 
Of criminals 
By a winning family story 
Arresting image 
, it ultimately delivers 
Imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and 
Spectacle and 
Remotely topical or sexy 
Generosity 
's get this thing over with 
The ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative 
One of the most savagely hilarious social critics 
Creative belly laughs 
Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
Charge money for this ? ' 
Hoping for a stiff wind 
A stadium-seat megaplex 
Has a real filmmaker 's eye 
An overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek 
Demonstrate their acting ` chops ' 
The effort is gratefully received 
So clumsily sentimental 
Feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
Will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience . 
That it ca n't really be called animation 
As south park 
Jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
To blandly go where we went 8 movies ago ... 
Has n't aged a day 
Fall to pieces 
Any summer blockbuster 
Resonance 
A beguiling freshness 
You 're in the right b-movie frame of mind 
... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
Burnt out 
Long enough to read the subtitles 
Maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout 
Have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed 
Disappointment coming 
Stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper 
( ahola ) has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation . 
Excellent performances on its side 
Comes along only occasionally 
The film 's predictable denouement 
Malarkey 
Will have a fun , no-frills ride 
A delightful romantic comedy 
Seems worse for the effort 
Greatest star wattage 
Juliette binoche 's sand is vivacious , but 
Amused by its special effects 
Distinct rarity 
The music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all . 
Does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances 
A highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet 
More bizarre than 
You love the music , 
The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , 
Sabotage 
Do n't work in concert . 
Devolves 
Narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann 
Formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , 
Should scare any sane person away . 
Its promising cast 
Ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
As filling as the treat of the title 
Too sappy for its own good 
... del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
`` looking for leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
That explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
Us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose 
Mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism 
Changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
To the floor with a sickening thud 
You might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman 's approach 
I fear 
Smart little indie . 
, but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
A deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city 
A film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
Stylish thriller . 
Becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary 
Own languorous charm 
Eventual discovery 
Zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
Disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look 
She has the stuff to stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy 
Supremely hopeful 
Various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale 
Most every aggrieved father clich�� 
The ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play 
The lively intelligence of the artists and 
But something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective 
Gorgeously strange movie 
Its own thinness 
Miracle of miracles , the movie 
Be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans 
Powerful documentary 
Such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting 
In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
Real magic , 
Anything but frustrating , 
Deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation 
Huppert 's show to steal 
That it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
Flops 
Genuine dramatic impact 
Retro uplifter .

You 'll know a star when you see one .

Are worthwhile 
Warm , fuzzy feeling 
Meaning in relationships or work 
Is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film 
Faster , livelier 
Can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
A coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clich��s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type 
Doomed 
That no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery 
Of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
Some of the computer animation is handsome , and 
Emphasizes every line and sag 
Dumped 
Is one of my least favorite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
Convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does n't have big screen magic 
Suckers 
As if he or she has missed anything 
Kate is n't very bright 
Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
Faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , 
Does a solid job of slowly 
Hate yourself for giving in 
Bucked the odds 
The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
Nicholas nickleby '' is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there 's no new `` a christmas carol '' out in the theaters this year . 
This fascinating look at israel in ferment 
A guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion 
The acting is just fine , but 
A full-frontal attack on audience patience 
At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability 
Is virtually absent 
Living hell 
If you 're willing to have fun with it 
It 's tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too . 
Some outrageously creative action in the transporter ... 
Cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) 
, this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
Count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is 
Search of something different 
Even better than the first one ! 
It is more than merely a holocaust movie 
Of director john stockwell 
Eerily accurate depiction of depression . 
Potentially good 
Working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli ... 
Suffers through this film 
Stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore 's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
Among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
The gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story 
Small , intelligent eyes 
Keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired 
, an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
Smoother or more confident 
Cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and 
Mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing 
Pacino is the best he 's been in years and keener is marvelous 
It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
Is about to turn onto a different path 
Glamour 
With a momentum that never lets up 
Is both stimulating and demanding 
Earnest , 
Movie special 
A bowser 
Failing , 
His character awakens to the notion that to be human 
An eloquent , deeply felt meditation 
If you 're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
Like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series 
, more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
Flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- 
Lighter 
's easy to like and 
Flat as thinking man 
It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and 
That it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
A visionary 
Most intelligent viewers 
The evocative imagery 
Could use a little more humanity , but 
, superficiality and silliness 
Predictable storyline 
Disposible 
Babak payami 's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot 
Is one of the best actors there is . 
It 's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 
Andie macdowell 
Its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
With vibrance and warmth 
Best movie work 
Despite auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
Toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` dungeons and dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry 
On toilet humor , ethnic slurs 
All the signs of rich detail condensed 
Of crucifixion 
With the pale script 
Noisy 
Warning you 
The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
Is an uncompromising film . 
Deeply unsettling 
Has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
Unforced 
Since ghostbusters 
A film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences 
Inject some real vitality and even art 
Some buoyant human moments 
Like the best 60 minutes 
Share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
May go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j. 
Is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
The surprise ending is revealed 
A cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should 
Intriguing characters 
A flimsy excuse 
, it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup 's anchoring performance . 
Do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved 
Seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers . 
A fanciful motion picture 
By halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course 
An enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment 
Empowerment 
Than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence 
Offensive , puerile 
Repetitively 
Makes it a failure as straight drama 
A hip comedy 
Is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights 
Willing to express his convictions 
With or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
Thanks to the actors 
An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 
This oddly sweet comedy 
The insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative 
With a better script 
Frustrates and 
Hard-pressed 
Drop dead gorgeous

There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and 
Extremely talented musicians

With the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural 
The film 's appeal 
Contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions 
When you 're a jet 
With subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film 
Stock character camp 
Just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
Fans 
To capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances 
Low-grade cheese standards 
Milks drama when she should be building suspense

Catches you

Also intriguing and honorable , 
Of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight 
Well-meant but 
Witless 
So heartwarmingly motivate 
Gangster no. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . 
Astounding on any number of levels 
The cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative 
Disrobed most of the cast , 
The young actors , not very experienced 
You 've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out 
Estranged from reality 
Enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well 
Wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text 
So hot-blooded 
A better lot 
A loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
Highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting .

The prospect of their own mortality 
A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . 
Is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit 
The weight of too many story lines 
Of new york 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief 
Robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favor of an altogether darker side . 
A well-balanced fashion 
That it 's a rock-solid little genre picture 
Sympathetic without being gullible 
Irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what 
To fill time 
's the image that really tells the tale 
Care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress 
Self-indulgent and maddening 
Has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
The richness of characterization 
I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great ... 
Being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright 
, this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento ...

And engaging examination 
A whole lot of fun 
Armageddon 
Delights and simmering

Sex 
Bad company 
A surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences 
Dry , reliable textbook 
The only fun part of the movie 
Under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
The pungent bite 
Spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it 's more than a worthwhile effort . 
The sweet cinderella story

Settles too easily 
In which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels 
Xxx is a blast of adrenalin 
Charming 
Imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . 
Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor 
Hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time 
Often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments 
Elbowed aside 
The film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
Cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting 
Comic elements 
Undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title 
An arcane area of popular culture 
How sandler is losing his touch 
Borrows a bit from the classics `` wait until dark '' and `` extremities '' ... but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
In the spirit of the season 
Barn-burningly 
The incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes 
Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- 
Exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
A far bigger , far more meaningful story than one 
Pleasurable 
Original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up . 
... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
Piercingly affecting ... while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
's still a guilty pleasure to watch 
Uncanny tale 
To see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , 
For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown . 
Three-dimensional characters 
Things to like 
A deserved co-winner 
You 're a jet all the way 
The first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ... 
A lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
Several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , 
There 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising 
On the premise 
Just slopped ` em together here 
Is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery 
A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three 
Adrift in various new york city locations 
That 's what i liked about it 
Unrelated shorts 
Screenwriting award 
So badly made on every level that i 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it 
Energy , intelligence and verve 
Straightforward 
Why this distinguished actor would stoop so low

Much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 
The dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you wo n't be disappointed . 
Of three 
Affirms 
It 's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
Dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` the thing ' and a geriatric 
It 's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
Sparking debate and 
's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating 
Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .

Moviegoers not already clad in basic black 
Is shallow , offensive and redundant 
Badly made on every level 
To eat popcorn 
An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit 
No french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half 
What 's missing from this material 
That most frightening of all movies -- 
Most brilliant and brutal 
's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
Heartily sick 
And ( too ) short 
The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .

Real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way . 
Has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
That is really funny 
The thrills 
Third time 's the charm ... 
To get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company 
Watching monkeys flinging their feces at you 
Like a can of 2-day old coke . 
Sink it 
The audience was put through torture for an hour and a half 
's also not very good 
Unsurprising 
Is n't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one 
As fresh 
Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control 
By an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers 
, it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women . 
Like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
Shadowy 
Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama 
Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
With passion and attitude 
Very funny 
Most late-night bull sessions 
A frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni 
Teens are looking for something to make them laugh 
Intriguing what-if premise 
Gives the lie to many clich��s and showcases a group of dedicated artists 
Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold . 
To be something really good

What made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring 
Absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer 
That lifts your spirits 
Catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
Linger long after this film has ended

Held my interest precisely because it did n't try to 
Confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye

Say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch

I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
Become wearisome 
Manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
Chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
Fact , the best in recent memory

Consistently amusing but 
Even lazier and 
Artful

The sword fighting is well done 
Much of it is funny , 
Extremely unpleasant film 
Should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting 
Very meticulously but without any passion 
A blair witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
A sentimental mess 
Passion 
Genuine insight 
A classic fairy tale 
, and not strictly in the knowledge imparted 
Aficionados of the whodunit wo n't be disappointed 
I enjoyed . 
Strong dramatic and emotional pull 
Is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew 
Road to perdition does display greatness , and 
The rest of the film ... is dudsville . 
Ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- 
Its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered 
Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` scooby ' do n't . 
Will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination 
Does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head 
The rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j. 
Nonsensical and laughable 
A very charming and funny movie 
The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
Tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers 
That it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own 
A great combination act 
With a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .

's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california 
The soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it 
Its scrapbook of oddballs 
Is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive 
No point 
No idea of it is serious 
Schmaltz 
Does a solid job of slowly , 
, characterization , poignancy , and intelligence 
As big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west 
Ourselves and 
A little uneven to be the cat 's meow , but it 's good enough to be the purr . 
Any film more challenging or depressing 
Seem sincere , and just 
Even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . 
Engaging and moving portrait 
How it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery . 
` swept away ' sinks . 
Is a great deal of fun . 
Report card : does n't live up to the exalted tagline - 
Rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest 
It eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
It earns extra points by acting as if it were n't 
Wayward wooden one 
Disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera 
Uncomfortably strained 
Going wrong

Ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production 
Ethical and philosophical 
As an exceptional thriller 
With star power , a pop-induced score 
Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work 
One of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs 
While it can be a bit repetitive 
Its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and 
Badder 
Does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
He has n't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film 
Does n't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 
A stunning new young talent in one of chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries 
Barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it 
As if everyone making it lost their movie mojo 
With second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds 
Proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies 
Off-putting 
Acidity 
Love in remembrance . 
Vivid characters and a warm , moving message 
, in itself , is extraordinary . 
Gives everyone something 
Is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues 
Neither as scary-funny as tremors nor 
Pleasantly 
Its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures 
Did no one on the set have a sense of humor

Hardly watchable

There 's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him . 
A mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities 
You 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
Immensely entertaining look 
That between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers 
A film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense 
're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins 
Enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . 
And effective film 
Complex

Enjoyable family 
Bad movie 
While bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals 
Gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . ' 
Funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness

An american actress who becomes fully english 
Is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting 
Funny , touching , smart and complicated 
Ignites 
As the movie dragged on 
Walled-off 
Refreshingly unhibited 
The saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world . 
Still rapturous after all these years 
Self-conscious art drivel 
Brutally dry satire 
Most refreshing

Great acting 
Well-structured 
This will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . 
Wonderfully loopy tale 
Turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
Every cheap trick 
Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , 
It takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance 
A time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater 
Marvelously entertaining and 
The cartoon in japan that gave people seizures 
Treating female follies 
A downward narcotized spiral

Rewarding 
Intermezzo strain 
Another key contribution

Enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious 
Been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement

Director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about drumline is its energy 
( a ) soulless , stupid sequel ... 
Escape the shackles of its own clich��s to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks 
Like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
Bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans 
None of the crackle of `` fatal attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 weeks '' , or even 
Manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy .

Represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream 
`` new best friend '' 
Mr. polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival 
A huge sacrifice of character and mood 
Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .

General audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music 
Crude film 
Defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
Really adorable italian guys . 
It must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior 
Loud and boring 
To hide the fact that seagal 's overweight and out of shape 
Everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar 
Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling 
The same number of continuity errors 
If the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on 
The most offensive thing about the movie 
A game of ` who 's who ' ... where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences 
Should n't have been made 
Exhilarating new 
This story of a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments .

A testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones 
An important , original talent in international cinema 
She 's cut open a vein 
Life and beauty 
Captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience 
've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic 
Charm , generosity and diplomacy 
A spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
Is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise 
The ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain 
Its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , 
May be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families 
It 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i 'm likely to see all year 
Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
Unfunny and unentertaining 
A movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling . 
're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does n't have big screen magic . 
Fuzzy

So distasteful 
Like a blown-out vein 
Erotic or sensuous charge 
Artistically inept 
Predictable and cloying

It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
Davis ' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take 
This is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . 
From the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories 
Obvious determination to shock at any cost 
To be because it plays everything too safe 
A revealing look at the collaborative process and

Cop flick cliches 
Crafted , and well executed 
It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
Some terrific setpieces 
Decent kid-pleasing 
Deeply unsettling experience 
Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion 
Are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor 
More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
More enjoyable than its predecessor 
With more holes than clyde barrow 's car 
Forcing 
O fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , 
Allen 's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
Are actually fascinating 
Somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
Murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud ... and parmentier . 
Moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming 
Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed . 
Writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
In asia , where ms. shu is an institution 
Love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly was n't feeling any of it

Phoned-in business as usual . 
Make this a comedy or serious drama 
Highly watchable 
's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion 
The screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him ... there is never really a true `` us '' versus `` them '' . 
Some talented performers 
My wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy .

Walk to remember '' 
Crass and insulting homage 
Makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook 
Complex and quirky , 
Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
's also uninspired 
Unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations 
Some cynical creeps 
An appealing veneer 
Cause loads of irreparable damage 
Has less spice than a rat burger 
The movie 's wildly careening tone 
Comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
Uphill or something 
The worst 
To courage and happiness 
Sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
Is enough to save oleander 's uninspired story . 
With an original idea for a teen movie 
Benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters ' moves and overlapping story . 
Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go 
Amusing , but ultimately so 
Avary seems to care about 
Map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own 
Exceptionally good 
Were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose 
With it 
Adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
That seem so real in small doses

Outstanding thrillers 
Gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake

Idiotic 
The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine 
It also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , 
Stay away . 
Tacky and 
Obscenely bad dark comedy 
's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
On top of a foundering performance , ( madonna 's ) denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
Deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe 
Weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
Elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender 
Is a bowser 
Its dark , delicate treatment of these characters 
A light ( yet unsentimental ) touch 
Offers an unexpected window 
That breaks your heart

What makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
Well-written as sexy beast 
That even tunney ca n't save 
The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , 
Our close ties with animals

An ungainly movie , ill-fitting 
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but

A thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy . 
Hitchcockian suspense 
Deadly dull 
Fine , focused piece 
Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests 
A highly spirited , imaginative kid 's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he 's afraid of his best-known creation ?

Nubile young actors 
Impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise

It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity 
Does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject 
Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , 
Sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
Other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
Ridiculous and 
Fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness 
Found the perfect material 
That the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone 
Convince us of that all on their own 
Fine 
What a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents 
Irreparably drags the film down . 
Berry 's saucy , 
, eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
Too amateurishly square 
Terribly monotonous 
It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more . 
And unoriginal mess 
The extent to which it succeeds is impressive . 
So insanely stupid 
's a rock-solid little genre picture 
Of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition 
Enjoyable film 
Horrors ! 
Adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking 
That makes as much of a mess as this one 
Be particularly innovative 
A heartening tale 
Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia 's true emotions ... 
A cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
Own staggeringly unoriginal terms 
Can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
The only thing i laughed at 
Is too insistent 
To squeeze a few laughs out of the material 
Feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group ... and never fails to entertain . 
, at 66 , has stopped challenging himself 
Leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt 's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying 
Relatively flavorless 
Subversive 
Mind-numbingly , indescribably bad 
The story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
And unsettling subject matter 
Exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
To drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other 
He will once again be an honest and loving one 
Promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish . 
Trip tripe 
Unsuccessful 
Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic 
Into an excruciating film 
As beautiful , desirable , 
Unusual , food-for-thought cinema that 's as entertaining as it is instructive 
Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness . 
Suffer ' 
An admirably dark first script by brent hanley 
Rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . 
Of genres that just does n't work 
Slowed down by a stroke 
Blatant product placement 
Been lost in the translation 
Little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating 
To triumph over a scrooge or two 
This starts off with a 1950 's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast 
An invaluable service 
Brisk 
A sappy , preachy one 
Gone straight to video 
An ultra-loud blast 
Several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
Asylum material 
Clean 
Astonishingly pivotal role 
's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise 
Made me unintentionally famous -- as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . 
Seems to remain an unchanged dullard 
Winning story 
Of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable 
Of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences 
I liked the movie , but 
Fondness 
Stamina and vitality 
To be more than another `` best man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film 
Magical 
Elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry .

You 're a fan of the series 
This mess of a movie 
Mcgrath 
Provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 
Roman polanski 's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than ` shindler 's list ' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie 
Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n't encountered since at least pete 's dragon 
's best 
Is visually smart , cleverly written 
; not the craven of ' a nightmare on elm street ' or ` the hills have eyes , ' 
With passion 
Director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time 
Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell 
Is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination 
At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting 
Straight-ahead thriller 
Quite simply , should n't have been made 
Into a cinematic poem 
Assume is just another day of brit cinema 
, you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
The sense of fierce competition 
An infectious enthusiasm 
And , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful 
Does n't work as either 
How horrible 
Elevates the material above pat inspirational status 
It adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed . 
Is that i ca n't wait to see what the director does next 
It is hard to resist 
A domestic unit finding their way to joy 
Gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake 
Environmental pollution 
Alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
Katzenberg 
Funny , sexy 
Other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- 
, but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances 
Run out screaming 
Is richer than anticipated 
A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama 
A tone of rueful compassion ... reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events . 
Boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse 
Intrigue and human-scale characters 
A crisp psychological drama ( and ) 
Attracting 
Entertaining , if somewhat standardized , 
Blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is 
Where this was lazy but enjoyable 
Hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses 
Traditional layers of awakening and ripening and 
's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year . 
Though flawed 
The depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen 
Mediocre 
Feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
Ca n't even 
The film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy 
It 's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british 
Very well shot 
An ideal 
Manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun 
Wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
Another visit 
Clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . 
Actually make a pretty good team 
It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer 
A four star performance 
Not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us 
Breaks no new ground 
Mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
Ill-equipped 
Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking 
Than indecent proposal 
Is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending 
Might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy 
Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess 
Who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop 
May not look as fully ` rendered ' as pixar 's industry standard 
Certainly not without merit 
Leguizamo 's best movie work so far , 
Too fancy 
Fulfill its own ambitious goals 
His genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace 
While obviously aimed at kids , the country bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
An emotional wallop 
Is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow 
Speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . 
A delightful lark for history buffs 
Obnoxiously 
We 've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there 's an enthusiastic charm in fire that makes the formula fresh again . 
The extreme generation ' 
Is not easily dismissed or forgotten . 
This painfully unfunny farce 
It looks good , sonny 
On badly-rendered cgi effects 
I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
His audience an epiphany 
Its unadorned view 
The material is so second-rate 
Where 's the movie here ? 
Metaphor 
The bourne identity should n't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood 
Of ' a nightmare 
Boring before i see this piece of crap again 
We hate ( madonna ) within the film 's first five minutes , and 
Control-alt-delete simone as quickly 
An oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain 
Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece 
The huskies are beautiful , 
Suitably anonymous chiller 
Convinced of its own brilliance 
Indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant 
A conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man 
Is too busy 
's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned 
Making kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , 
Is anything but languorous 
For the character at all stages of her life 
Been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky 
As the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby 
Heart-pounding suspense 
Wo n't hold up over the long haul 
Has the usual impossible stunts 
The most consistently funny 
's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels 
Sexual jealousy , resentment and the fine 
It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past . 
Silly-looking morlocks 
( lin chung 's ) voice is rather unexceptional , 
Glib 
The striking , quietly vulnerable personality 
Wonderful ensemble cast 
Often funny way 
Loves a david and goliath story 
Is the power of love 
A talk that appeals to me 
Static set ups , 
Stirring tribute 
Felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
The subject with fondness and respect 
Reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race 
The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
Mindless pace 
Might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds 
Very depressing 
Governmental odds 
He 's the best brush in the business 
A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . 
Is a very funny , heartwarming film 
The best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
As best actress 
Safely recommended as a video/dvd babysitter 
Watch barbershop again if you 're in need of a cube fix 
Into a really funny movie 
Humorous 
Too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil 
It does n't disappoint . 
-- however canned -- 
Offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves 
Lazily 
Appeal 
Gut-wrenching examination 
Works so well for the first 89 minutes , but 
To merit such superficial treatment 
Is a small gem 
Peaked 
Kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
A weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
Irrational 
Comedy , caper thrills and 
Equally distasteful 
Shared by the nation 
Are too immature and unappealing to care about 
A fairly irresistible package 
Where its recent predecessor miserably 
A great performance 
Its courageousness , 
, time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
All the scenic appeal of a cesspool 
George 's haplessness and 
Her agreeably startling use of close-ups 
That is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain 
Is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish 
That deserves a chance to shine 
's a lyrical endeavor . 
The film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original , but one ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters . 
It will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
Decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces 
Lousy way 
Love , memory 
The working class to life 
That , quite simply , should n't have been made 
The middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics 
A portrait of alienation so perfect , 
Ugly , revolting 
Schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms. mirren , who did ) , 
The lousy john q 
Mike white 's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor 
Warm , inviting 
Zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film 
Worst way 
In its poetic symbolism 
A happy , heady jumble 
The 3-d vistas from orbit 
An endearing cast 
Glaring 
Remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing 
Nudity 
Made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
Rolling your eyes 
She loves them to pieces 
To make a big splash . 
Offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and 
Would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest 
Is still charming here 
A real shame 
No amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge 
The world 's best actors 
The visual panache , the comic touch , 
Accused of being a bit undisciplined 
The silver screen 
A nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
Complaining 
It is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
Is repeated at least four times . 
The evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film 
Also need movies like tim mccann 's revolution no. 9 . 
-- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- 
Savory and hilarious 
Appealing leads 
Has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic 
Has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself 
Ranges from bad to bodacious 
As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
Bitter 
Relatively gore-free 
, but i suspect it might deliver again and again . 
Is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn 
Inadequately 
All-around good time 
Exceptional detail 
Its own meager weight 
The best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
Neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price . 
Jaw-dropping action sequences , 
Of political corruption 
Fun-loving 
Allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another 
Is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
Filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
Turns very dark and very funny 
Junk-calorie suspense tropes 
Unentertaining 
Ambiguous ending 
... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
Also treats the subject with fondness and respect 
's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series 
Add 
Curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading 
Believable 
With minimal imagination 
A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
He was reading the minds of the audience . 
Dramatically satisfying heroine 
Musicals back 
Something fishy 
Acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake 
Portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety 
Assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
You will likely prefer to keep on watching . 
To be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this 
Quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
A stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films 
Cruelly 
Nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving 
Is one of mr. chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny 
Feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
Trusts the story it sets out to tell 
The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
That plays things so nice 
Be post-feminist breezy 
As you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
Such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one 
A refreshing and comical spin 
Loads of irreparable damage 
Chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
Playful respite 
As miraculous as its dreamworks makers 
, purpose and emotionally bruised characters 
Direct hit 
It 's a quirky , off-beat project . 
Its execution and skill of its cast 
Of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults 
The bizarre is credible and the real turns magical 
An effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence 
But its just not a thrilling movie 
Brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she 's cut open a vein 
Forgettable 
That is slow to those of us in middle age 
Relying on the viewer to do most of the work 
Insufferable 
A decent ` intro ' documentary 
The creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree 
Scoring high 
Artsy fantasy sequences -- 
When are bears bears and 
Impossible to care about 
's too much syrup and not enough fizz 
Overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
Something a little more special behind it 
High-profile talent 
Of shakespeare 's better known tragedies 
Thought-provoking and often-funny drama 
Together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
Chan 's uniqueness 
Looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
Tick-tock 
Sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot 
Driven by a natural sense for what works 
Steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious 
The cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 
, pasty lumpen 
Surprisingly ` solid ' achievement 
Slip into hokum 
Is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
The third revenge of the nerds sequel 
Narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins 
Inspired portrait 
Is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals 
Sensuous and spirited 
Awfully hard 
Elegant and 
Shines on all the characters , 
Oleander 's uninspired story 
At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance 
Roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
Has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
Cultivation 
A visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except 
You 're desperate for the evening to end . 
Insufferably naive . 
Come during that final , beautiful scene 
Class warfare 
Nice rhythm 
Evans ' career 
The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed 
Presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation . 
Is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness 
's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure 
Reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds 
A stunning new young talent in one 
Five screenwriters are credited with the clich��-laden screenplay ;

Your first instinct 
A thoughtful movie , 
Of elizabeth berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm 
Being good 
Have to pay if you want to see it 
Friendship , love , and the truth 
A good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz 
Best describes this film : honest 
Fresh , sometimes funny 
Aggravating and tedious 
It 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals 
've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time 
Comic sparks 
On the subgenre 
Fast-paced contemporary society 
Satisfyingly odd and intriguing 
A purposefully reductive movie 
That it goes nowhere 
A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
If kaos had n't blown them all up 
Scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
Emphasized 
Obnoxious special effects 
's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion 
Boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape 
A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences 
A satisfying evening at the multiplex 
A low-budget affair 
Uplifting , 
Infuriating about full frontal 
To duck the very issues it raises 
Derrida is all but useless 
Of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world 
Subtle and 
Deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) 
That is where ararat went astray . 
Has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest 
Spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects 
Completely misses its emotions 
That make 105 minutes seem twice as long 
Does n't have much panache , but with material this rich it does n't need it 
Of dedicated artists 
The richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable 
Their cheap , b movie way 
The film is static 
Render it anything but laughable 
Live-wire 
Conventional but heartwarming tale 
Be so light-hearted 
No worse 
Listless , witless , and devoid of anything 
By orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but 
Filling nearly every minute ... 
Wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie 
Beyond-lame satire 
's better than its predecessor 
What is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination 
Offers escapism 
Pretty stupid 
It 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten 
Our special talents can be when put in service of of others 
The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
Since beauty and the beast 
Nasty aftertaste but 
Hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful 
Overall , it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message 
Stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
Bad mixture 
Cinematic corpse 
Ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought 
Amazingly successful 
There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening . 
Gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , 
88 minutes of exaggerated action 
Do not go gentle into that good theatre . ' 
And immature character 
The most politically audacious films of recent decades 
Is the only winner 
To blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
Is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
Overcome bad hair design 
Does n't really go anywhere 
The rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations 
Misery 
The glorious chicanery and self-delusion 
To rush to the theater for this one 
Manages to string together enough charming moments to work . 
Most romantic comedies 
Ultimately insignificant 
Not-so-divine 
Be patient with the lovely hush 
Remarkably assured 
Trudge out of the theater feeling 
300 hundred years of russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement 
We are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
Washed out 
By top-billed star bruce willis 
Does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
The occasional bursts 
Wise enough 
This so-called satire 
Is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
Rock 's stand-up magic wanes . 
Bombastic self-glorification 
The ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy 
Its excellent storytelling , 
Zeal 
Sinks into an abyss of clich��s , depression and bad alternative music 
Too many conflicts 
Wretchedly unfunny wannabe 
Advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly 
Retard 101 
A wild comedy 
A comic book with soul 
Done , but slow 
Must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face 
Are consistently delightful . 
Could n't 
Raffish charm 
That 's unfocused and tediously exasperating 
Pull his head out of his butt 
One hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities 
To hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory 
Is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . 
Marvelous first 101 
Interesting movie 
A way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span 
That really does n't have much to say beyond the news 
Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
So memorable 
Who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb 
Date-night diversion 
It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction 
Meyjes ' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor 
It 's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
Loss 
Invigorating 
Puerile 
, can not overcome blah characters 
Indie of the year , so far 
I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
Gentle and engrossing 
Than its sunny disposition 
Gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown 
An energizing 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply 
Confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be 
's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
Heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter n?ss ' delicate , clever direction ... and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
Uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
Is so convincing 
Meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story 
The process created a masterful work of art of their own 
Love the film 
Though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor 's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
I.e. peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable 
Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . 
Mummy and the mummy returns 
Too overdone 
's the perfect star vehicle for grant 
In a light-hearted way the romantic problems 
An inept , tedious spoof of '70s 
Over this `` un-bear-able '' project 
Dramatic and emotional 
Screen presence 
Too shallow for an older one 
Film legacy 
, magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock . 
Cool gadgets and creatures 
Finery 
Takes every potential laugh and 
Would do better elsewhere . 
Reassures us 
One of the best war movies ever made 
Horrible , 99-minute 
A very depressing movie 
The film is well-crafted and 
There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references 
Terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and 
Depraved 
Found writer-director mitch davis 's wall of kitsch hard going . 
Fun in this cinematic sandbox 
A major movie 
Attempt to bring cohesion to pamela 's emotional roller coaster life 
Do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes 
That he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure 
Many false scares 
Stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter 
Who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 
I realized that i just did n't care 
Am��lie 's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin 
Its laid-back way 
Its lack of poetic frissons 
Ever spill from a projector 's lens 
No earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
Half past dead -- or for seagal 
Art and commerce 
An astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) 
From the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed 
Is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract 
The talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
A biting satire that has no teeth 
Does n't have anything really interesting to say 
The ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound 
Every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do 
Fans of plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , 
's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire 
Like the similarly ill-timed antitrust 
Leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
Superb performance 
Funny stuff in this movie 
To head off in its own direction 
The most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm 
'll still be glued to the screen . 
Finely crafted , 
Until things fall apart 
Dime-store psychology 
Do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition 
High crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government / marine/legal mystery , 
Marks an encouraging new direction for la salle 
To bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes 
Adept 
Covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people 
A solidly entertaining and moving family drama 
An almost palpable sense of intensity 
Such a horrible movie 
Incoherent jumble 
Audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but 
Get it 
A single surprise 
Biggest husband-and-wife disaster 
Like a sucker 
Rob schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
An intoxicating show 
Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly 
A lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer 
Hardly a film that comes along every day . 
And wonderful creatures 
It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
To match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 
A movie with depth 
It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied . 
Best rock 
A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film 
Below may not mark mr. twohy 's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished . 
Ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times 
Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby ! 
You might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead . 
In this romantic comedy 
A real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who 's ever 
Is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
Does n't deliver a great story , nor 
Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof 
A bitter taste 
Seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character . 
Of cuban leader fidel castro 
Has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references 
From two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected 
Skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
Their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse 
Originality ai n't on the menu 
's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring 
It was a guilty pleasure 
Stylistically 
Purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
Forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film 
's a very valuable film ... 
Clever ideas and visual gags 
Should be themselves 
's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
Some robust and scary entertainment 
That this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that 
Jazzy new revisionist theories 
Is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
The one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , 
The frustration , 
Bad and baffling from the get-go . 
Complex characters 
Not be a breakthrough in filmmaking 
Would n't want to live waydowntown 
The film is deadly dull 
I 'd watch these two together again in a new york minute . 
's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise . 
Stylish cast 
Sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
Genuine love story 
's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor 
Has worked wonders with the material 
Than this facetious smirk of a movie 
Knows its classical music 
Through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture 
Fairly impressive debut 
Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . 
Is more timely now than ever 
But it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us 
Fantasti 
Dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
Honest , and enjoyable 
Intoxicating documentary 
Dependable concept 
A visual treat for all audiences 
The cast is spot on 
Delicate ambiguity 
Weaves us into a complex web 
Generating suspense 
Gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel 
Any doubt that peter o'fallon did n't have an original bone in his body 
Sexist 
Genteel and unsurprising 
Their own immaturity 
Is so earnest that it 's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . 
For its intelligence and intensity 
Funny , moving yarn 
Should be as entertaining as it is 
Stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made 
Worthless , 
The audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival 
Viewers out in the cold and 
Kinetically-charged spy flick worthy 
Like mere splashing around 
The most enchanting film 
The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
Cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity 
A great movie it is not 
, like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
Plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world 
The bravery and dedication 
The edge of your seat for long stretches 
The equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay 
Dopey dialogue and 
Does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
Whose meaning and 
Follows into melodrama and silliness 
Overcome blah characters 
Hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ... 
Fun family fare 
The film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
The lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . 
Does n't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
Playfully profound ... and 
It recycles every clich�� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
A tarantino movie with heart 
By casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings 
Baked 
Lasting impression 
Difficult , endless work 
A shock-you-into-laughter intensity 
Melodramatic movie 
Has ( its ) moments 
That he 's the best brush in the business 
, very well told with an appropriate minimum of means . 
The premise of `` abandon '' holds promise , 
Must have failed 
A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them 
With lots of somber blues and pinks 
Losin ' 
Loquacious and dreary piece 
, invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film . 
Crawl up your own *** in embarrassment 
Dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten . 
It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins . 
On offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid 
Has many of the things that made the first one charming 
To worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances 
Run-of-the-mill singles blender 
Mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time 
Like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
A clever 
Awfully entertaining 
Does not translate well to the screen 
Perfect family film to take everyone to since there 's no new `` a christmas carol '' out in the theaters this year 
Psychotic than romantic 
Also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
A cellophane-pop remake 
It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
Pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone 
Leaks treacle from every pore . 
Boasts some tart tv-insider humor 
Remarkable film 
Waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
Capable cast 
The run-of-the-mill singles blender 
Both gripping and compelling 
Sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers 
Them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world 
On a true and historically significant story 
If you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic 
A well-defined sense 
The consciously dumbed-down approach 
Could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he 's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary 
Is a filmmaker of impressive talent 
Flick that scalds like acid . 
's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
A landmark 
To portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man 
With a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction 
Meaningful 
Has a rather unique approach to documentary . 
The haphazardness of evil 
The film has several strong performances . 
Whose boozy , languid 
A meatier deeper beginning 
The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution 
Most creative , energetic and original 
Epic cinema 
Has n't graduated from junior high school 
A film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience 
A treasure chest of material 
An intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
Try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags 
For a satisfying evening at the multiplex 
It was going to be 
Reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world 
The bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it 
A damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film 
That hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers 
Yelling in your face for two hours 
Will undoubtedly enjoy it 
Walk to remember 
Moderately successful but 
Becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are 
, its shortness disappoints 
Succeeds in entertaining , 
Shows off a lot of stamina and vitality 
This fast-paced 
End up laughing 
A smile 
An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode 
That it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones 's diary 
Almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy 
Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
Makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful 
Eight legged freaks ? 
In milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title 
That fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation 
Like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
A walk to remember a niche hit 
, accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
Welcome in her most charmless 
The otherwise good-naturedness of mr. deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely new york celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything sandler 's been attached to before . 
Hollywood comedies such as father of the bride 
Get no satisfaction 
It is wise 
Brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life 
This one feels like a life sentence 
A compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
Anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie 
Good yarn 
Is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless 
Is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame 
Mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and 
Gets the job done 
One of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but 
None of the happily-ever 
The evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear 
Very satisfying 
In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick 
Gooding is the energetic frontman 
Film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days 
Naturally charming 
The rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema 
Into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' 
Petter n?ss ' delicate , clever direction 
Remarkably dull with only caine 
The characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 
To a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time 
Feels like a prison stretch 
Secretary 
Of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls 
Visually atrocious , and often downright creepy 
Come with the warning `` 
The plot of the comeback curlers is n't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what 's unique and quirky about canadians . 
A soulless hunk 
Conventional but heartwarming 
Unencouraging 
Big screen magic 
Not smart and not engaging 
Of good acting 
Bitter and truthful 
Also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl 
After seeing the film , i can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
People act weird 
Rote work and predictable 
An obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? 
This film that may not always work 
As a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions 
Entertaining on an inferior level 
Young american 
On all levels 
One of the better video-game-based flicks , 
Except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine 
African-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans 
We have a bad , bad , bad movie 
Flails 
For the most part , credible 
's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i 've seen . 
Broken characters 
A winning piece of work 
Digs into their very minds 
Good , solid storytelling . 
Polished 
The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
Of a love affair 
Tasteful to look at 
Devito 's misanthropic vision 
Perfect movie 
Little catch 
Pauly shore awful 
To whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept 
's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
Tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier 
In all its director 's cut glory , 
That loses sight of its own story 
Grace and panache 
Engaging and exciting 
Is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast 
Of a frustrating misfire 
As subtle and as enigmatic 
Dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous 
Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid 
Goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun 
Get all five 
Magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock . 
Is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking . 
A coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
Updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
Acidic all-male 
Inimitable diaz 
Had some success with documentaries 
Take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act 
If you 've the patience , there are great rewards here . 
That there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film 
Frosting 
The usual whoopee-cushion effort 
Entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller 
'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up 
Lazily directed by charles stone iii ... from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
Mediterranean sparkles 
Leers , 
The film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
Want to pack raw dough in my ears 
Been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations 
To make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them 
Nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life 's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . 
Well-made pizza 
Earnestness 
Mind-numbingly 
Go-for-broke acting that heralds something special 
For a few comic turns 
Is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened 
Is sure to win viewers ' hearts 
Does n't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather 
Pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama 
Emerge dazed , confused as to whether you 've seen pornography or documentary . 
Junk-calorie 
Leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , 
Is engage an audience 
Think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version 
One that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom 
Swept away 
With a serious minded patience , respect and affection 
The huskies are beautiful 
A dark pit 
Here ... not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
Minority report 
Its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner 
Troubling and powerful 
Hooting it 's praises 
Does n't do more than expand a tv show to movie length 
A skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation ... 
, clever 
A unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief 
This cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
A well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists 
It 's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
Singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 
Like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers 
Their own brightly colored dreams 
Splashy and entertainingly nasty 
Its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ... 
Feel-bad ending 
Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . ' 
Not a bad way 
Member 
, paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years . 
Is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
In that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short 
You wo n't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
Something as splendid-looking as this particular film 
There are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it 's going to be a trip . 
Unexpectedly sweet 
The right time in the history of our country 
His chemistry with shimizu is very believable 
'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , ( crane ) becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
Too grave for youngsters 
Fabuleux 
On the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness 
On the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid

Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... ghost blimp 
Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
A creepy , intermittently powerful study 
Set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years 
Inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable 
A great film 
Meeting , even exceeding expectations 
Unique and entertaining twist 
Solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
A sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss 
Making it one of the best war movies ever made 
Listless , witless 
Of fun or energy 
Will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have 
... feels as if ( there 's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
For bathroom breaks 
Pleasurable expressions 
A frustrating ` tweener ' --

Sprung from such a great one 
Nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . 
A strong sense of humanism 
Fun and enjoyable 
A riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche 
Has all of dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
Incoherence and 
Traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at 
Good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe 
Is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch 
Sheerly beautiful film 
Time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
Be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script 
Incredibly thoughtful 
Who inhabit it 
A weary journalist 
Assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and 
Went over my head 
Successful example 
Served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service 
A nagging sense 
As lumpy as two-day old porridge 
Of the best actors there is 
There are also some startling , surrealistic moments 
Post-september 11 , `` the sum of all fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
Ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot 
Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
To the point of distraction 
That have reinvigorated the romance genre 
Of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job 
The globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm 
Cringe 
Funny yet dark 
A major waste ... generic . 
A bad movie that happened to good actors . 
A crowd-pleaser , 
The glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about 
Vonnegut 
The film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
Asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
Of daring films 
Of an impression 
Like a copout 
Are all more than competent 
`` shakes the clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and 
The hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages 
That it is laughingly enjoyable 
Amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest 
Intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery . 
The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable . 
Retelling 
Am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! 
( the film 's ) taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers 
Let 's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 
's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , 
The attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
More revealing , more emotional and more surprising 
Timeout 
Is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . 
There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami 's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 
Dim-witted and lazy 
A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr. chicken . 
Skillful 
Did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection 
Easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity 
Seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device 
Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
You 've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles

O fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing .

Which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director 
When a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there 's something there . 
Hollow at its emotional core

But they 're simply not funny performers

No clear-cut hero and no all-out villain

Pay reparations to viewers

The problem with wendigo

Most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings 
Sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
Is still a cinematic touchstone . 
Very sweet 
A-list director 
Fun and funny in the middle , though 
But it was n't horrible either 
You 'd want to smash its face in

Pan nalin 's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , 
Resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue 
Holds a certain charm 
Stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid 
The perfect cure 
Of bible parables and not an actual story 
The best sex comedy 
A movie that is n't just offensive 
Incisive and sensitive 
Is difficult to fathom

About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
Apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway 's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
Trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed 
Dreary , humorless soap opera 
The story really has no place to go since simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict 
So rich with period minutiae 
That deserved better than a ` direct-to-video ' release 
Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence 
Of adolescent violence 
It 's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .

Another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise 
He can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
Anything but laughable 
The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .

Of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i 
It is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus 
A story that zings all the way through with originality , humor and pathos 
A film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . 
Archly funny 
But still entertaining 
Entertaining to watch the target practice 
It just does n't have anything really interesting to say . 
Would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows 
His work with actors is particularly impressive . 
It 's plotless , shapeless -- 
Poetic force 
While dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
As i 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material 
Originality ai n't on the menu , but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
The emperor 's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality . 
The film ultimately fails 
( tsai 's ) masterpiece 
Unleashes 
Endless trailer 
Yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
A fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system 
Does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture 
No , i hate it . 
Real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way 
Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
Kind , unapologetic 
`` suck '' 
Does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
Impressive style 
An irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling 
One big blustery movie 
A bad improvisation exercise 
The dimming of a certain ambition 
Writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic 
This visual trickery 
For the best of hollywood 's comic-book 
Will be something to behold 
Is a visual treat for all audiences 
Succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing . 
Painless 
The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained 
A compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one 
Sometimes quite funny 
Any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
Of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties 
A genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound 
Surprising emotional depth 
The tiresome rant 
A barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground 
An aimless hodgepodge 
Convey a strong sense of the girls ' environment 
A handsome and well-made entertainment 
Are reflected in almost every scene 
Are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock 
Imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix 
Tenderly observant of his characters 
As a dystopian movie 
Digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations 
Guts and 
Do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage 
Acquires an undeniable entertainment value 
A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun . 
Freaks 
Too insistent 
Laughably unconvincing 
Expertly 
Is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
This ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun 
A dungpile 
Spiritually 
Can go home again 
The message is too blatant 
A sweet and modest 
Is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed 
Energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 
The horrible pains 
It 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
Is awful 
Its solemn pretension 
While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one 
As a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible 
Altered 
It is handled with intelligence and care 
Being bored 
Its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation 
Kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull 
The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
Realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's reign of fire 
It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and 
A dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor 
A straight face 
Is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage 
Bad cinema 
Yields surprises . 
This dream hispanic role 
Make it an above-average thriller . 
Unlikable , spiteful idiots 
Headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film 
Easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing 
Pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet 
The screen to attract and sustain an older crowd 
That place , that time 
More simply intrusive to the story 
Outdated 
It 's not entirely memorable 
Work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds 
The ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham 's novel ) 
Anthropomorphic 
Like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain 
Frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director 
Seriously bad film 
In trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole 
Impressive roster 
Innovators 
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c.h.o. still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
A more annoying , though less angry 
Are sometimes inexpressive 
There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups 
Enthusiastic audience 
A series of relentlessly nasty situations 
It also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience 
Another genre exercise , 
It 's the worst movie of 2002 
Witlessness 
Great fun , 
From `` promising 
Wildly careening tone 
Who learns that believing in something does matter 
Larded with exposition 
In that something 's horribly wrong 
As the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year 
Dry humor and jarring shocks , plus 
At 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
As visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room 
Youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness 
All its agonizing , catch-22 glory 
Engrossing 
This delicate coming-of-age tale a treat 
The artwork is spectacular 
This a charmer 
They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so

In a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny 
Chilling style 
Proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
Robotically 
Displays in freshening the play 
With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral 
's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
Could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking 
Little action 
The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
Into sub-tarantino cuteness 
Visually atrocious ,

Which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway 
It 's ) a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
Could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time 
Much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , 
Denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
Leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature 
The same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who 's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films 
The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
But it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
Hold society in place 
Like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
After seeing ` analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
One of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right

Doubt it 
Was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
Viewers will wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned . '' 
Of impressive talent

There 's something vital about the movie . 
Few sleepless hours

's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas 
Just the labor involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
Have been an eerie thriller 
Most substantial feature for some time

Arrest development in a dead-end existence 
, it 's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
Incredibly 
So sloppy , so uneven , so 
The intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work 
Fantasy pablum 
Family dynamics 
You 'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
A fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- 
He 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
Idiotic 
For finding meaning in relationships or work 
Is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it . 
An `` ambitious failure 
Enjoyable in its own right 
A lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family 
Of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis 
To entertain all ages 
Compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen 
The negative and the script 
It 's offensive 
As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice 
Goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
A film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor 
All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders 
There 's no conversion effort , 
Has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , 
The inherent absurdity of ganesh 's rise 
Offers winning performances and some effecting moments . 
With flabby rolls 
Has plenty for those ( like me ) who are n't .

Looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
Gussied up 
Mishmash 
Seamless and sumptuous stream 
Able to pull it back on course 
For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time .

A clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest 
Decent performances

Frida gets the job done . 
Know the band or the album 's songs by heart

Rather unexceptional 
Fairly ludicrous plot 
Adventures 
Sleek and arty . 
Eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story 
Easy , seductive pacing 
Must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 
Makes up for with its heart . 
Imaginative filmmaker 
A substantive movie 
It 's mostly a pleasure to watch . 
With all of this 
, the score is too insistent 
To put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese 
That actually has a brain 
An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing 
Editorial process 
Closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel 
A side dish of asparagus 
They wo n't enjoy the movie at all . 
Winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say 
Gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time 
Were a person 
Poetry in motion captured on film . 
Flat as a spoof 
Are pretty valuable 
A smart , nuanced look 
The new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
Like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going 
Three-hour endurance test

Meyjes 's movie , like max rothman 's future , does not work . 
Is masterly 
Stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . 
Constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey 
Abrupt 
This often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
An overwhelming pleasure 
Silly stuff 
Is much more p.c. than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) 
Pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
Does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy 
Constant smiles and frequent laughter 
His sly , intricate magic 
Predictable , manipulative stinker 
This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but 
Like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale 
Enlivens this film 
A showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film 
Extremely unpleasant 
For each other 
Morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about 
Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
Unfortunate title 
Is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
A four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script 
To get at the root psychology of this film would require many sessions on the couch of dr. freud . 
The problem with the bread , my sweet 
Lost dreams 
Sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile 
Builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love 
That starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable 
Looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
Forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer

Its impressive images 
Has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
Gentle longing 
Very compelling 
An already thin story 
Uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
Turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count 
90-minute dud 
Ensures the film never feels draggy . 
's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller 
That reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm . 
A riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades 
Scruffy , dopey old 
Genuine and sweet 
Of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies 
Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much . 
's surprisingly decent , particularly 
He 's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness . 
As though they are having so much fun 
A movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears 
A sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise . 
Overly familiar 
Can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards . 
Distinguished 
Likely to seduce and conquer 
The background -- a welcome step 
` christian bale 's quinn ( is ) a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . ' 
Marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity 
Gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
Before you pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead 
Life 's ultimate losers 
, what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
Is a slapdash mess 
Speeds up 
Insanely violent and very graphic 
Nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , 
Satisfactorily 
Fried in pork 
The emotional depth 
Concentrates far too much 
Eclipses nearly everything else she 's ever done 
Populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
Familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it 
Of things that elevate `` glory '' above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall 
Prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
About their lives , loves and the art 
Is off his game 
A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
This is a big , juicy role 
A very complex situation 
It 's really well directed 
A valentine sealed with a kiss 
Theater feeling 
To farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances 
Cliches and pabulum 
Constant fits of laughter 
Wobbly 
Secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way 
Is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she 'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
In a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
For the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time 
Irresistible 
Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
, it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who are n't . 
To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and i wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough 
A pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion 
Dry the undead action flick formula 
Dull girl 
Bungle their way through the narrative 
Yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . 
Actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny 
Joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate 
Is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that 's hard to resist 
The nifty premise 
The sad schlock merchant of ` deadly friend 
The film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable 
That welcome to collinwood is n't going to jell 
Is that it counts heart as important as humor . 
It tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period 
A heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs 
Scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an 
Dog soldiers does n't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it 
Smooth and professional 
Naomi watts is terrific as rachel 
A-list brit actors 
Grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun 
Playful and haunting 
The type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days 
Winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
Tossed in 
Its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
For some robust and scary entertainment 
Such a pleasure 
Shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski 's the pianist , but 
A troubadour 
Of that already-shallow 
Its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue 
Even lazier 
On a string of exotic locales 
A fresh way 
The exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes 
` ick ' 
Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour 
It is derivative 
The crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware 
Of high art 
Despite all the backstage drama 
Are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
Squarely fills the screen . 
All the queen 's men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen 
Top-billed star bruce willis 
A good yarn -- 
Too late 
By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion 
A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
Lost the ability to think 
, you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
A sensitive , moving , 
If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ?!? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie 
To flat characters 
Cinematic poem 
Boiling point 
The rich performances by friel 
A meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the `` a '' range , as is , it 's a very very strong `` b + . '' 
Maddeningly insistent and repetitive 
Dream 
Unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , 
Everything kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art 
Degrading and 
It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag . 
Compelling story to tell 
The film 's intimate camera work and 
A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached 
That it 's more than a worthwhile effort 
This quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
Is no doubt true 
An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability 
Clear-cut 
Be a breakthrough in filmmaking 
Succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system 
Beautiful 
Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
Each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
How bad it is 
The film shatters you in waves . 
The movie 's downfall 
Sometimes murky 
The first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . 
Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
Add much-needed levity 
From any movie with a `` 2 '' 
Another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate 
Boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp 
Because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , 
If it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for . 
Called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but 
Brilliant in this 
Its utterly misplaced earnestness 
Nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length 
Sluggish , 
Four-star 
'' is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
Holiday carol 
Some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling 
Never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
Flat acting

Most brilliant work 
Condescending 
Is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal 
The star who helped give a spark to `` chasing amy '' and `` changing lanes '' falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` the sum of all fears . '' 
With the american dream 
May not be a straightforward bio 
Especially grateful for freedom 
Has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
Van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
Eerie thriller 
Using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook 
We got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter 's the thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
Joy and pride 
You crave chris smith 's next movie 
You can fire a torpedo through some of clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any oscars . 
In the best way 
Exquisitely 
Improperly hammy performance

It does not attempt to filter out the complexity 
Banged their brains into the ground 
The funniest and most accurate depiction

Aspires to be more than another `` best man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
, ` swept away ' sinks . 
Respects the material without sentimentalizing it 
Incredible storyline 
The beauty 
For the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff 
A perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower 
A tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
Plant smile-button faces 
Knockout 
, the film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
Are so stunning 
Never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ... 
This movie is careless and unfocused . 
That effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres 
Crisp and 
Zany ' 
Fuddled 
Amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , 
Thrill you 
Invite some genuine spontaneity into the film 
Boring movie 
The film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding 
Warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer 
To do with imagination than market research 
Of oral storytelling frozen onto film 
A self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence 
Awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful 
Dramatic snapshot 
Portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
An animation landmark as monumental as disney 's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . 
The catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
Sentiment and withholds delivery 
We hate ( madonna ) within the film 's first five minutes 
Style and bold colors 
More like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead 
Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring 
Best performance 
Is a little too in love with its own cuteness 
Hilarious and 
That 's not scary , not smart and not engaging 
The comic elements of the premise , 
Expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup 
Uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real 
Could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
's an utterly static picture 
Hate it because it 's lousy 
This fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
You peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes 
Leave a lasting impression 
Miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin 
An old-fashioned scary movie , 
, inspiring 
Weak and ineffective ghost story 
Is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose 
Into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich��s and showcases a group of dedicated artists 
Modern masculine journey 
Soars 
The courage 
Manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity 
Is a very good viewing alternative for young women . 
The animation master 
For a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
Gone wrong 
The earmarks 
Quick-buck sequel 
Inventive director 
Sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
Director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , 
The dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and 
Improves upon the original hit movie 
Such good humor 
An oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
Demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking . 
Is a truly , truly bad movie . 
Happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . 
An unlimited amount of phony blood 
Going out and enjoying the big-screen experience 
Is tepid and tedious . 
Quirky and taken with its own style

Bogs down in genre cliches here . 
Scotland looks wonderful 
It really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` evelyn . ' 
More simply intrusive 
Jaw-dropping action sequences 
Acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice 
Overrun modern-day comedies 
It 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough . 
Is scott 's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph 
Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
Of delightful hand shadows 
To the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl 
Humanizing stuff 
, ms. shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
Brooding 
Gabbiest giant-screen movie 
Horrifyingly 
Even-toned direction

Falls flat 
Depressing to see how far herzog has fallen 
Never cuts corners . 
Is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings 
Contrived , 
's there to scare while we delight in the images 
The genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
Exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor 
Comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
A smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy 
Should catch this imax offering 
It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it is n't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
Is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
A lot of fun , with an undeniable energy 
A beautiful paean to a time 
The gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself 
This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
Bravery and dedication 
Visceral excitement 
Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm 
Divine 
The story really has no place to go since simone is not real -- 
Unique way shainberg 
Which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title 
Nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film 
Julia roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism 
But disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera 
The duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream 
Satisfies , as comfort food often can 
, captures a life interestingly lived 
A literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit wo n't be disappointed . 
's undeniably hard to follow 
Hate it . 
Can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie 
Originality 
Ai n't art 
Has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal 's overweight and out of shape . 
The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe 
Has some freakish powers of visual charm 
The unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better 
Hypnotically dull . 
Juvenile delinquent 
Who is chasing who or 
Infectiously enthusiastic 
Rare 
Sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness 
Seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times 
Is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic 
The visceral excitement 
Suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable 
The film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
Spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet 
A recommendation 
Shining 
Directed and convincingly acted 
An honesty and dignity 
Enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , 
Ca n't wait to see end . 
Serry 's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context 
Worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
A powerful 1957 drama we 've somehow never seen before 
's plenty to enjoy -- 
It has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect 
To show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
Final verdict 
Allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being . 
Is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film 
Beguiling 
, '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` tonight . '' 
Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
There is no denying the power of polanski 's film ... 
Video before month 's end 
, its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
That 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd 
Chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . 
These components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
Just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain 
Of animated filmmaking since old walt 
To be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms 
So it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking 
The mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype 
's hard to like a film so cold and dead 
Damon/bourne or his predicament 
'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
Pacino is the best he 's been in years and 
Able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . 
Gives these women 
Will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
Tosses around sex toys and offers 
Fantastic 
This clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
Moments out of an alice 
Looks genuinely pretty . 
Is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
A great cast and a great idea 
Unexplainable pain 
Make great marching bands 
Fine actors 
, glaring and unforgettable . 
Deserves to be seen everywhere . 
Thoughtful minor classic

Has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star 
Frames ) profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment 
Cancer 
A wonderful life marathons and bored 
Cliche-ridden film 
A solid , unassuming drama . 
That the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character 
, it 's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him 
Has a terrific look 
Thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest 
There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 
Noble 
They are in this tepid genre offering 
Fails to provoke them . 
Left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . 
Better at fingering problems than finding solutions 
Better than the phantom menace 
Is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
Demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
Be underestimated 
The story is just too clich��d and too often strains credulity 
A flourish 
's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
Quick-cut edits 
Family film sequel 
An affectionately goofy satire that 's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary 
In middle-of-the-road blandness 
Than a half-hearted fluke 
Has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history . 
Proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
Fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting 
Of exploiting molestation for laughs 
` possession , ' based on the book by a.s. byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit 
Steven soderbergh does n't remake andrei tarkovsky 's solaris so much as distill it . 
Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six . 
That van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material 
The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general 
Sprung to life 
History in perspective 
Could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy 
Rather listless amble 
Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
Is n't very effective 
He 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing 
It must be the end of the world : 
Schlocky creature 
Feels like a copout 
A cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy 
Finesse 
Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject 
Schneidermeister ... makin ' a fool of himself ... losin ' his fan base 
Loosely speaking , we 're in all of me territory again , and

Sad nonsense , this 
Uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
To grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
An inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population 
Something a little more special behind it :

Inventive , consistently intelligent and 
Sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins 
As the protagonists struggled 
Melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements 
Of hype 
An odd show , pregnant with moods , 
Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
Refreshingly forthright 
Perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .

Progressed as nicely as ` wayne 
This oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
Beats new life into it 
Splendid singing 
A long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes 
Do n't really care for the candidate 
Are not at all entertaining 
Deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
Stale plot and pornographic way 
The self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows . 
Potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
Only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at 
In which the talent is undeniable 
What gives human nature its unique feel 
Paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and

The most pitiful directing 
A moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan jos�� campanella 's reputation in the united states .

Based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , 
An infomercial for ram dass 's latest book 
Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame 
Of story and his juvenile camera movements 
A temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining 
Bolstered by exceptional performances 
Dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool 
If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
Dark , intelligent warning cry 
Is far from disappointing , offering an original

Could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one 
She may not be real , but the laughs are

Fluid 
Juliette binoche 's sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .

It pretends to expose the life of male hustlers

Perfect wildean actor 
With impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect 
Do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold . 
That finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s 
An emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need 
Should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days 
Really cool 
It was particularly funny 
For conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
Superhero 
Clich��s and borrowed images 
Possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance 
Is a must ! 
Accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 
Assured , vital 
Tediously exasperating 
Of life and small delights 
( and better ) 
Has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition 
General family chaos to which anyone can relate 
Technically sumptuous but 
An effectively chilling guilty pleasure 
Saved from 
A space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) 
As banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention . 
Only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
Aground after being snared in its own tangled plot 
, the old mib label stands for milder is n't better . 
Stale and uninspired . 
Including the assumption that `` crazy '' people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny 
Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
Makes it look like a masterpiece 
Content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
Of a good time 
A spiffy animated feature 
The best sports movie 
The troubling thing about clockstoppers 
Picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like 
Prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny 
Quirky and recessive charms 
Surprise us with plot twists 
Makes this a high water mark for this genre 
Badly-rendered 
( hopkins ) does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it . 
's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary 
Gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear 
Make this an eminently engrossing film 
Let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best 
Work better 
About schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . 
With the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought 
Most importantly 
Should scare any sane person away 
Life 's wonderment 
Could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s 
Not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original 
Remains brightly optimistic , 
Scooby-doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
Mentally `` superior '' 
Its sleazy moralizing 
Amusedly , 
Engaging , 
Is so convincing that by movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others 
Like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless 
Yet unforgivingly inconsistent 
Wo n't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies . 
In favor 
-- sadly -- 
's all about anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
Affectionately 
A great impression 
, the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters ' moves and overlapping story . 
It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , 
Farts , boobs 
Joyous documentary . 
Crudely 
Another wholly unnecessary addition 
Want to see over and over again 
A rather bland affair . 
Of the nincompoop benigni persona 
Say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful 
Might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women 
Finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
With pitifully few real laughs 
One of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 
As faithful portraiture 
According to the script , grant and bullock 's characters are made for each other . 
One of the best ensemble casts of the year 
Is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane 
Makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates 
Is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor 
For those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
Runs 163 minutes 
Is devoid of wit and humor 
That it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride 
It never lacks in eye-popping visuals 
A serious minded patience , respect and affection 
Uncharismatically 
That 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh 
Enjoyable ease 
It 's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
Pretty good little movie . 
Another classic 
Rehashes to feed to the younger generations 
Lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail . 
One of this year 's very best pictures 
More confused , less interesting and more sloppily 
Defend himself 
Gets sillier , not scarier 
Can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold 
Does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story 
Its delivery is a complete mess 
Snide and 
Ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) 
A compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp 
Long workout 
Boom mikes 
So flabby 
Half the excitement of balto ,

Are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones 
Debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
Walked away from this new version of e.t. just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes 
Emphasizes the computer and the cool 
To big box office bucks all but guaranteed 
Telling 
Tattered and ugly past 
A warm , fuzzy feeling prevails 
The worst film of the year 
Brightly colored dreams 
Beautifully shaped 
The holocaust escape story 
Humble 
Something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers 
But even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic . 
In which most of the characters forget their lines 
Murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team ... 
As original and insightful 
Brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images 
One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
Involving in its bold presentation 
Look like a masterpiece 
An enthusiastic charm 
But then again , i hate myself most mornings . 
Jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music 
Astonishingly condescending attitude 
, it does n't even seem like she tried . 
Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
Demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were . 
It 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
, do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ? 
Encompasses many more paths 
The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca n't remember a single name responsible for it . 
Stylized humor throughout 
're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over 
Is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
To work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds 
Garc��a bernal and talanc��n are an immensely appealing couple 
Traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations 
I know that i 'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again 
Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . 
You can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
Inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
Takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights 
Are lacking 
, the power of this movie is undeniable . 
Exceptional 
Its position 
Like shrek , spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
Created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
Frothing 
Brilliant performances 
The movie 's messages are quite admirable 
Perfect family film 
Makes the formula fresh again 
To forget that they are actually movie folk 
Gaping enough to pilot 
Are very expressive 
Beating the austin powers films at their own game 
Pokes , provokes 
The procession 
Is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
The needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage 
This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep 
, they 'll probably run out screaming . 
Sharply comic 
( tries ) 
Jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , 
A time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
Like it 
Advantage 
Could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay 
Can depress you about life itself . 
Hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry 
To grow boring ... which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience 
Halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; 
Guns , violence

Entirely wholesome ) 
Most of the movie 's success 
Is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines 
Confident filmmaking

Trickery 
Managed to convey a tiny sense of hope 
Is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
Alexandre dumas classic 
Is more likely to induce sleep than fright 
A tragic love story 
Any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice 
Focus , point and purpose 
Capable 
Mortal awareness 
The new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , 
A pathetic , endearing hero 
If allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself 
It is an uneven film for the most part 
Contrived pastiche of caper clich��s . 
Cold , gray , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated 
Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and 
Exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
Lasker 's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther 
The really bad blair witch project 
Make such a worthless film 
Collapses 
Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit 
Will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing . 
Twinkling 
Endorses 
Mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich�� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( woo 's ) best work 
You exit the theater 
Self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence 
Creep the living hell out of you 
Like the guys 
Gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear 
The ridiculous dialog 
Is definitely a cut above the rest . 
Boozy 
There is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
Be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' ( 1999 ) and ` analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year 
Brilliant and macabre 
Endearing and easy 
A ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating 
Slapped together 
A reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
Sag in certain places

Deeply affecting film 
No more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) 
Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest 
The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . 
Has a lot of charm . 
Two ideas 
Absorbing documentary 
The characters are paper thin

Destroy 
Queasy 
The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task 
... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project ! 
The action is stilted and 
About telling what at heart is a sweet little girl 
Its strengths 
A plodding mess 
Robert harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- 
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books 
'll find in this dreary mess 
Powerful and provocative 
Is a just a waste . 
Is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
That is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
Pleasant in spite of its predictability 
She is a lioness , 
Of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds 
Jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat 
Aims to confuse 
There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but `` elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases 
Finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
Comes off winningly 
The best film 
Takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
` comedy ' scenes 
Very pleasing at its best moments 
Awkwardly contrived exercise 
Two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd 
Is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice .

While the story 's undeniably hard to follow 
Is not quite the career peak 
Can comfortably hold 
It would still be beyond comprehension 
Nelson 's intentions are good , but 
With a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else 
Retrospectively , his most personal work yet .

Of high romance , brought off with considerable wit 
May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
Wonderous accomplishment 
Emotionally strong and politically potent 
The kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller 
Jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor 
As sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth 
Rare directors 
It 's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . 
Mr. wollter and ms. seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
Serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale 
Listless

Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . 
Fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count 
One of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace 
A much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue 
Could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .

The insightful writer/director 
Wildly inventive

Elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy .

Look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy 
Could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip 
Is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer 
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw 
Solid sci-fi thriller 
Otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
The cold light 
A subzero version 
A great deal of fun 
This deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
Blade 2 
Capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark 
Neither as scary-funny as tremors

An interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
Well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin . 
Modern master 
The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing 
Is the film roman polanski may have been born to make 
Imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
Who play their roles with vibrant charm 
The french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
Remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be 
Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .

Oddly sweet comedy 
With flashes of warmth and gentle humor 
Boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually 
Thoughtful examination 
An engaging and intimate first feature 
The theme does n't drag an audience down 
Contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
A vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 
's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics 
Despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
None of the crackle of `` fatal attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 weeks '' , or even `` indecent proposal ''

While the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
Fred schepisi 's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point .

Searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces 
, you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
, this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
A choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes 
Yes , it 's as good as you remember . 
Coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs -- and 
Quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
Are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
A kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
Enjoyably 
, annoying , heavy-handed 
This 20th anniversary edition of the film 
A cutting hollywood satire 
Keen eye , sweet spirit and 
That have preceded it 
As simple self-reflection meditation 
As a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable 
Blazingly alive and admirable 
, the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker 's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art . 
Evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat 
Our sympathies 
The book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most 
, this film should not be missed . 
Is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
A sharp , amusing study 
Thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
Interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) 
A muted freak-out 
Wants to break free of her old life 
The thrill of the company 's astonishing growth 
An old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher 's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue . 
, viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure . 
With a smile on your face 
I liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed 
Like you 've actually spent time living in another community 
To the flowering of the south korean cinema 
Goodness for this signpost 
Recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from lonely boy to 
Is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative 
Unique residences 
, unholy hokum . 
A glorious spectacle like those d.w. griffith made in the early days of silent film 
Comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
That 's neither completely enlightening 
Most jaded cinema audiences 
To sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals 
Catch it ... if you can ! 
Cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay 
Certain sexiness 
A lively and engaging examination 
Silly but strangely believable 
His maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place 
Lasting traces of charlotte 's web 
Not smart and 
High-profile 
To the gallic ` tradition of quality 
The little nuances 
The result , however well-intentioned , 
A hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant 's two best films -- 
This schlocky horror/action hybrid 
Utter authority 
A solid , unassuming drama 
Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable 
A charge of genuine excitement 
Witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . 
In a movie that works against itself 
Her film 
A blown-out vein 
The new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and 
Is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action 
For kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure 
Oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique 
From the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
With her actors 
Much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever 
's stupid 
Funny and poignant 
A tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director 
Insufferably 
Warm and 
It 's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
Disney scrape 
Star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
Well-timed 
Immensely ambitious , 
Indulgence 
Transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama 
The beach 
The more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies 
Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s american sports movie . 
A moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide 
Dumbed-down 
Is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
, well-crafted family film 
Stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
A movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
Should see it as soon as possible 
Add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb 
Imbued with passion and attitude . 
Brought down by lousy direction 
Forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - 
A stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal 
That deserves recommendation 
Fatal ailments 
A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
A joyous communal festival 
Opera-ish story 
's not very interesting . 
Encourage 
With a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil 
A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view 
Faithful to melville 's plotline 
The best performance 
It may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
, wan na watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? 
Surrealist flourishes 
To intolerable levels 
, broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
Report card : does n't live up to the exalted tagline 
Talented cast 
Typical pax 
Is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast 
's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment 
This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful 
Mesmerize 
Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
A film that are still looking for a common through-line 
A gorgeously strange movie 
Were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn . 
's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as greenfingers 
Very compelling , sensitive , intelligent 
Off the hook 
A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
, then you 're at the right film . 
Gently tedious in its comedy 
But it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
Creates images even more haunting than those in mr. spielberg 's 1993 classic . 
Is a pretty good job , 
Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
Invitingly upbeat 
The ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham 's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism 
Carrying more emotional baggage than batman 
A macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
Features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 's block ever . 
A grittily beautiful film that looks 
Dysfunctional parent-child relationship 
Flimsy ending 
To a satisfying destination 
Except for the fine star performances 
A disquieting and thought-provoking film 
However , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
Authentic to the core of his being 
Is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
Seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity 
Viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor 
Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do 
Visually engrossing 
The top japanese animations 
By lousy direction 
Hip comedy 
But unmemorable 
Scare while we delight in the images 
With its own solemn insights 
Grows monotonous 
Is nothing in it to engage children emotionally 
Film buzz and whir 
Indie tatters and self-conscious seams 
Incurably 
Disney 
Has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
Manages to be even worse than its title 
Bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
Such high-profile talent 
Oliver stone 's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy 
Campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast 
Often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
Erotic 
The stunt work is top-notch ; 
Of its critical backlash and more 
Undemanding armchair tourists 
How this gets us in trouble 
That grand a failure 
The worst sin 
Is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself 
Its body humor and reinforcement 
Complex , politically charged tapestry 
From the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea 
Realize your mind is being blown . 
A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies . 
Suffocating and sometimes almost senseless 
The excellent performances 
Allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances 
Will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids 
The sentimental script has problems 
Any age 
Why i have given it a one-star rating 
For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets ( sci-fi ) rehash . 
That he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle 
Ca n't deny its seriousness and quality 
Pseudo-philosophic 
Classified as a movie-industry satire 
It ` perfection 
A sweet 
A visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure 
Can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
Does n't so much phone in his performance as 
Knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , 
Of black indomitability 
Undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates 
Into the structure of relationships 
Smart movie 
Award-winning 
Is heartfelt and achingly real . 
Eerily accurate depiction 
Scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
Look as fully ` rendered ' as pixar 's industry standard 
Demanding 
Pok��mon 4ever 
Its moment 
To say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved 
Suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis 
First-rate cast 
Gently political 
Remembrance 
Enjoy the movie 
Figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand 
Is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs 
That jackie chan is getting older 
Makes you crave chris smith 's next movie . 
The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and 
Fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
Husband-and-wife disaster 
Nurtures the multi-layers of its characters 
Admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics 
Seems suited neither to kids or adults 
Old-world charm 
Torn apart by a legacy of abuse 
So not-at-all-good 
Rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . 
Worst -- and only -- killer website movie 
Passions , obsessions , and 
Fits into a classic genre , 
A rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation . 
, brooding and slow 
As well its delightful cast -- 
Consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and 
Engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary 
The right thing 
Is another liability 
That , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care 
By half-baked setups and sluggish pacing 
A lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer 
Heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible 
Seem odd bedfellows 
Purely abstract 
Thanks to the chateau 's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
A fragmented film 
Playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity ... bisset is both convincing and radiant 
A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : 
Characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
Often surprises you with unexpected comedy 
Proves she has the stuff to stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy 
This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
Juicy writer 
Right film 
, it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
Can not disguise the slack complacency of ( godard 's ) vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice 
Of neil burger 's impressive fake documentary 
Heartfelt concern 
Watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights 
Of the worst possibilities of mankind 
Miserable 
( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there 's something vital about the movie . 
Can be fruitful : ` in praise of love ' is the director 's epitaph for himself 
A cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron 
A rounded and revealing overview 
Enjoy the new guy . 
Is straight from the saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness 
A non-stop cry for attention 
Thoughtful , unapologetically raw 
Murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team 
Both heartbreaking 
Filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home 
Absorbing movie that 's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist 
Tickles 
Potty-mouthed enough 
Clumsy clich�� 
Through kafka 's meat grinder 
Invite 
That were already tired 10 years ago 
Regret and , ultimately , finding redemption 
It 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium 
The right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars 
To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 
The minds and hearts of many 
Sentimental 
Are simply intoxicating . 
Is kind of special 
The cinematic canon , 
Creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
Seem like such a bore 
Never having seen the first two films in the series , i ca n't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
Eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful 
's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
Sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , ( ahola ) has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation . 
If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational 
Is little else to recommend `` never again . '' 
The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
Simple-minded and stereotypical 
Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... 
Its unsettling force 
Half-assed film . 
Sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning 
Steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
Hard-hitting 
It 's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form . 
Incoherent 
As dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care 
Sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things 
Incredibly layered and stylistic 
At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
With really poor comedic writing 
Wastes its time on mood 
Is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism 
Greatest mistake 
Hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over 
Degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
Carl 
The disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort 
Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
Is a big letdown . 
Put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today 
This thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson 
( reaches ) wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
An hour and a half of joyful solo performance . 
Frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness 
Is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is 
Refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
Ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he 'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego . 
Predictability is the only winner 
Great crimes 
It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash. , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting 
Done that ... a thousand times already 
No means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act 
Of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery 
Good thing 
The feat with aplomb 
Strange and wonderful creatures 
The gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang 
Slow 
Ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients 
Less entertaining 
By england 's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing 
The film 's ill-considered notion 
Mattel 
The depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant 
Than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
By its lack of purpose 
Intimate and 
Seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else 
Fat 
Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material . 
Pick your nose instead 
'' and `` terrible 
The storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow 
Derivative 
All , a condition only the old are privy to 
More emotional force than any other recent film 
Is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay 
Wise-beyond-her-years teen 
The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
The film 's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it 's propelled by the acting . 
'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
So original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up . 
My own tortured psyche 
The most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich 
Fun-loving libertine 
's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh 
Break up 
A square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can 
Eat popcorn 
Deserves a place of honor next to nanook 
Is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb 
Wafer-thin 
Turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy 
The most original fantasy film 
's no conversion effort 
Uncool the only thing missing is the `` gadzooks ! 
To shout insults at the screen 
Genuine ones 
What madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
That the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop 
With a bouncy score 
One of the year 's best films 
A fleeting grasp 
Appreciate 
, there 's something vital about the movie . 
It all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
The euphoria 
Imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
Be best forgotten 
That ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot 
A listless and desultory affair . 
Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises 
Entertaining and informative documentary 
And insufferable ball 
The sleekness of the film 's present 
Was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise 
Its emotional power 
An ordeal than an amusement 
Well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too 
Was more diverting and thought-provoking than i 'd expected it to be . 
Smooth , shrewd , powerful act 
Glossy rehash 
The one not-so-small problem with expecting 
A nicely 
Unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers 
A soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism 
To cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be 
, delicately performed 
Perceptive , good-natured movie 
Almost saves the movie . 
Race splitting 
A work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived 
Exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) 
... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
As the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart 
Pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws 
Like a hazy high that takes too long to shake 
, and rousing 
Immature provocations 
Serve the work especially well 
Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
Graphic sex may be what 's attracting audiences to unfaithful , 
That were once amusing 
Tame 
Another gross-out college comedy -- 
Best spent elsewhere 
Distant 
The battle 
You feel genuinely good 
Like quirky , slightly strange french films 
First major studio production 
As a low-budget series on a uhf channel 
Successfully blended satire 
A high-powered star pedigree 
A waste 
Well-made 
Thought-provoking and 
Us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way 
Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and 
Is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
Have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries 
's worth yet another visit 
Expressionistic license 
The visual flourishes 
The script has less spice than a rat burger 
Explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut 
More mindless drivel 
Simply astounding 
Incompetent , 
Gets the tone just right -- 
Pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
However , it 's invaluable 
... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
Personal self-discovery 
Are great rewards here . 
Characteristically engorged and 
Who is chasing who 
's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience . 
Just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year 
Most good-hearted yet 
A gratingly unfunny groaner 
Cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view 
, like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
Most disappointing 
Sophisticated wit 
In a summer of clones 
Cliched dialogue and perverse escapism 
A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
Dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy . 
Feel like three hours 
Owes enormous debts 
Bogs down in a surfeit of characters and 
Insipid 
Seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
One regards reign of fire with awe . 
It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout 
Has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream 
The music makes a nice album , the food is enticing 
Schneider is no steve martin 
Murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy ... 
A unique culture that is presented with universal appeal 
's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , 
Humanity 's greatest shame 
Sweet cinderella story 
Is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
Makin ' a fool of himself 
An engrossing story 
Filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but 
, for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life 
Sucking you in ... and making you sweat 
Plays out ... like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller 's time out 
Is in his element 
Has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavors and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book 
A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying 
Enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
It 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
Does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting 
A happy ending 
George lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
Complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen 
Seem one-dimensional 
Throw each other out windows 
Though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
The worst movies of the year 
, poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .

Pure , exciting moviemaking 
, is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
Of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh 
It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .

Will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .

Of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies 
Nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and

Weighted down with slow , 
With low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard 
, it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich��s . 
, in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music 
What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` panic room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
And adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
Of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed 
Wanes 
Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
One of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers . 
The huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them 
Ms. hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda 's ultimate fate .

Know better than to rush to the theater for this one

Fishy 
Capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance 
Give it considerable punch . 
Sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then 
Will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness 
Is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype 
Delight . 
Become dullingly repetitive 
Much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments

The best thing i can say about this film 
A very slow , uneventful 
Fun and funky look 
The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
Spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are . 
A generous , inspiring film 
An awful movie

Of epic adventure 
Could bond while watching a walk to remember . 
Challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means

New best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay 
Its idiocy 
Respect and affection 
So teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside 
The requisite faux-urban vibe and 
Crowd-pleasing 
Rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world 
A familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence 
Itself , a playful spirit and 
In an admittedly middling film 
Is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
Low on energy

The payoff 
Like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel 
What 's most refreshing about real women have curves 
Little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out 
A bad premise , just a bad movie 
Pleasant piece 
That for the most part , the film is deadly dull 
Film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure 
It collapses like an overcooked souffl�� . 
That has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself 
Comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story 
Look ill at ease sharing the same scene 
Beguiling serenity and poise

That the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself 
A solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude . 
Made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
And weakly acted 
Faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , `` a walk to remember '' 
Wholly unnecessary addition 
Is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy 
Of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire 
A good-hearted ensemble comedy 
That 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot 
Affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . 
( gulpilil ) is a commanding screen presence , and his character 's abundant humanism makes him the film 's moral compass

With a certain degree of wit and dignity 
It 's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia 
Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .

The movie is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
Some of this laughable dialogue 
The irwins ' scenes are fascinating 
Being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett 's familiar quotations 
Mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain 
Nothing about this movie works . 
Make creative contributions to the story and dialogue 
Fun for all 
Is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way

Is a far smoother ride . 
Has not spawned a single good film . 
All about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings

Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or 
Gut-wrenching 
Interesting 
As any hollywood fluff

Mergers and downsizing 
Heartfelt romance

Able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn 
Logistically 
Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning 
A coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clich��s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
Could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent 
Its intended audience has n't yet had much science 
A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) .

Be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous ( than leon ) 
Loses its fire 
Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap . 
It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
Is clumsy 
A remake by the numbers 
But one thing 's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
's funniest and most likeable movie in years 
A refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale .

Give a thought to the folks who prepare and 
Combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller 
Most basic 
More holes than clyde barrow 's car 
Manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
Is more fun than conan the barbarian . 
Wonderful film to bring to imax 
Again and quite cheered at just that 
The sheer beauty 
Was as superficial 
Uncommonly sincere 
The casting of von sydow ... is itself intacto 's luckiest stroke . 
A bonus 
To paraphrase a line from another dickens ' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
In enough clever and unexpected 
Emotional force 
Fun and funny in the middle 
S1m0ne 's satire is not subtle , but it is effective

The following things are not at all entertaining : 
An american tragedy 
Child acting 
Squanders as much as it gives out . 
Repressed 
So convincing 
It completely contradicts everything kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art 
As if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us 
A shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions 
're over 25 
Should be relegated to a dark video store corner 
Rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year 
Nakata 's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects .

Ludicrous 
This rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs 
Is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation 
Full-length classic 
A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .

Clunky on the screen 
A look 
Not to be moved by this drama 
Of the worst of the entire franchise 
This illuminating comedy 
Times uncommonly moving 
Become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair 
There 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
Describes this film : honest 
It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
The molehill 
There is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
Distinguished film legacy 
Is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . 
A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither 
Absurdly simplistic picture 
Sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theater 
The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys ' direction is clever and insightful . 
To smash its face in 
A whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale 
, often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness 
Seems endless 
Fighting off the urge to doze 
Flavors 
In which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment 
To be the cat 's meow

There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
The cleverness 
Its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy 
A sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else 
Cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Be cherished 
The wildly popular vin diesel 
Love , duty and friendship 
That , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
Hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , 
A genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery 
Stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal 
Moving , if uneven , success 
Undermining the story 's emotional thrust 
Lacks aspirations of social upheaval 
Strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time 
A complicated hero 
A mediocre exercise in target demographics 
Ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling . 
Seen it all before in one form or another 
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
Are not to be dismissed .

Ordinary , pasty lumpen 
Is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart 
In cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
For someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains 
Has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters ' lives after the clever credits roll . 
His ninth decade 
Never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting

Last 15 years

In all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
Grand a failure 
Completely transfixes the audience . 
Long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr. chicken 
Are a couple of things that elevate `` glory '' above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall 
Intelligence and verve 
Loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion 
Great cinematic polemic 
Sometimes inadequate 
Even a little dated

Plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 
Thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign

Portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery 
The scuzzy underbelly 
See two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
, we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
Thoughtful and unflinching examination 
( haneke ) steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 
Beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing .

The film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
Through clever makeup design

Blatant and sickening product placement

Much-needed levity 
This story of a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone 
An immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century

Fascinating study 
Cheeky 
So formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory 
An athlete , a movie star

Emphasizing

That could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice 
Terrorists are more evil than ever !

It ultimately satisfies with its moving story 
Guessing plot and an affectionate 
A perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama 
Admitted egomaniac 
Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work 
's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes 
Constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense 
's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) 
Overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm 
Live up to material 
Follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and 
Which makes its message resonate . 
The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
Titillating 
Aplenty 
Morally alert 
Richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing 
What the english call ` too clever by half 
Is to be mesmerised . 
The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here . 
For all the dolorous trim 
Hell 
Introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers 
Its occasional charms 
From his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona 
Although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage 
On the soullessness of work 
Glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit

Stifles creativity 
Amusedly 
Repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences ,

What makes barbershop so likable 
Let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists 
Represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
Watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs 
A perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making

Hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , 
One of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
Unadorned

What jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery

Enjoyable trifle 
Emerges in the front ranks of china 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers 
Moonlight mile does n't quite go the distance 
Does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown 's life . 
It 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe 
Unnoticed 
A movie that 's held 
Smartly and wistfully 
Enervating determination 
A man has made about women since valley of the dolls 
Little more than a mall movie designed to kill time 
Significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration 
Becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle 
The leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
Hugely enjoyable film 
Effort to watch this movie 
Delivering oscar-caliber performances 
It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
Of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies 
Terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase 
Delightful , well-crafted family film 
With clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set 
The mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , 
And the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
Those exceedingly rare films 
That works 
Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs 
A decent tv outing 
Embraces its old-fashioned themes 
's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten 
As an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- 
Unbearably 
The film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be 
Return to never land is much more p.c. than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
Stylistic austerity and forcefulness 
The most enchanting film of the year 
Eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good 
As far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california 
Its need to reassure 
That captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower 
Limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror 
Stunning fusion 
Slight but sweet 
's packed with just as much intelligence as action 
Charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments 
Cinematic pollution 
's too loud to shout insults at the screen 
Extremely bad . 
Taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
Such a well loved classic 
, who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 
Hard to be mythic 
's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
Mishandled here 
Above all 
The awfulness of the movie 
Rises to its clever what-if concept . 
With the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling . 
A crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with 
There is one word that best describes this film : honest . 
A weird fizzle 
Superior moral tone 
Have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life 
To nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it 
Utter mush 
Sad , sordid universe 
Best possible senses

Have been a sketch on saturday night live 
Looks neat 
Feels like a prison stretch . 
Like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm 
A non-stop funny feast 
, it 's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
Conceptually brilliant 
Leather pants & 
Candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take 
Wonder of wonders 
Banged their brains into the ground so frequently 
Can easily be considered career-best performances 
Begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully 
Can say 
Good looks 
You 'll be rewarded with some fine acting . 
The girls-behaving-badly film has fallen 
Still has a sense of his audience 
As temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise 
If festival in cannes nails hard - boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
Half-assed 
The right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars 
Than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies 
A compelling story of musical passion 
Intelligent , caustic 
For teens to laugh , groan and hiss 
Comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won . 
Ending surprise 
Were n't such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play 
Features a standout performance by diane lane 
Makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student 's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted . 
Toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well 
No big whoop , nothing new to see 
The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
Anonymous chiller 
, indie trick 
A human volcano or an overflowing septic tank 
This alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot 
Aging , suffering 
Works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently 
Bronze 
Is a fascinating film 
Uninvolving storytelling 
Bordering on confessional 
Of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it 
His character 's deceptions ultimately undo him 
Effective moments 
Earnest moment 
You bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out 
Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
Spectacular 
A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious 
Feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
An exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film 
Somber , absurd , and , finally , 
Also happens to be good 
What 's infuriating about full frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense . 
If i said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of kung pow 
Sincere acting 
Deep , uncompromising 
He has no character , loveable or otherwise 
Pretends to be passionate and truthful but 
A `` home alone '' film that is staged like `` rosemary 's baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
Makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose 
Are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
Eastwood 's loyal fans 
Has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky 
That upends nearly every clich�� 
A movie with no reason for being 
The most fluent of actors 
Sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster 
Expert fighters 
Is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
Dreary and overwrought 
The characters are too simplistic to maintain interest 
Feel sanitised and stagey . 
Meandering and pointless 
A story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope 
The frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo 
Enjoyed the thrill of the chill 
Glows 
Splash without the jokes 
Of its gaudy hawaiian shirt 
The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast 
Far more alienating than involving 
Uncool the only thing missing is the `` gadzooks 
Caf�� 
( a ) strong piece of work 
A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera 
Sweet and sexy 
A moving tale 
That remains vividly in memory long 
Is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
Coming-of-age theme 
As well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics 
Huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people 
That we feel as if we 're seeing something purer than the real thing 
The new film of anton chekhov 's the cherry orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . ' 
This supposedly funny movie 
Full-bodied 
It churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action 
Writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call ` too clever by half . ' 
Crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy . 
Most enchanting 
As musty as one of the golden eagle 's carpets 
A touching , small-scale story 
A muddy psychological thriller 
Due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired 
Any real emotional impact 
Seem so real in small doses 
The best of both worlds 
An unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood 
Captivatingly quirky hybrid 
Director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon ,

Huge fan 
A predictable connect-the-dots course 
` fatal attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set 
Faith in the future 
Crap like this 
Complex , 
Flatly 
The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack 
Is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination , 
Many talented people 
The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- 
Somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
A marvel 
Just unlikable . 
Are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
Of teen-speak and animal gibberish 
A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
Driven by appealing leads 
The cast is phenomenal , especially the women .

Capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
Emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds 
A loathsome movie 
Hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure 
Songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
Dead 
Enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins 
Real-time rhythms 
Elegant , mannered and teasing 
Aggravating 
An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
Unlikeable people 
Of naivet�� and sophistication 
A fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life 
Lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
A canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss ... 
Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense

Overwrought comedy/drama

So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
Distasteful and downright creepy 
Funny documentary 
Deep intelligence 
A cold blanket 
The nicest thing 
You care about the characters 
More enjoyable than its predecessor . 
So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style

An interesting look 
Pulling on heartstrings 
Is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus 
The service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction 
Need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is 
I encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale 's tale -- you wo n't be sorry ! 
Oscar-caliber 
Nothing better to do with 94 minutes

Uninventive 
Is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . 
The children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks 
The hastily and amateurishly 
Becomes a tiresome clich�� 
Is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country . 
Distinctive 
Engaging storyline

A surgeon mends 
's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
A terrific role 
Too many barney videos 
Is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer 
A flood of emotion 
The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way . 
, with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
Overacted 
Begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters . 
Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them 
It could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one

A much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman 's similarly updated 1970 british production . 
There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
To endure instead of enjoy 
It might deliver again and again 
Enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over 
Guessing plot and 
Cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly 
Lurid 
... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
Another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke 
From a flat script and a low budget 
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . 
Match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try 
The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense

There must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally 
It 's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
Then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time 
Is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
While the third feels limited by its short running time 
It has its moments

Much worse than bland or 
Solidly constructed , entertaining thriller

It serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
That same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept 
You 'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it 
Monumental 
Must go to grant , who has n't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
Not exaggerated enough 
Interest can not be revived . 
The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : 
Can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good . ' 
Newcastle , the first half of gangster no. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood 
No means a slam-dunk 
It says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style 
Could be so light-hearted ?

Hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references 
Can take the grandkids or the grandparents 
To the gifted korean american stand-up

At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... 
Not a trace 
An unendurable viewing experience 
A more than satisfactory amount of carnage 
Otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clich��s 
We 've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world 's greatest teacher 
A cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater 
The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
Few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
- i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
Terrific b movie 
Whole family 
It is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , 
Antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it . 
Is energized by volletta wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness 
Is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie 
Both times 
A thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
, fetishistic violence 
Bombshell documentary 
We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together 
A misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire 
High note 
The charming result 
Also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
Toilet humor 
Smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play 
Are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . 
Too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations 
Make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and 
See a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
Perfect quiet pace

A vivid imagination and an impressive style 
Here is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation .

Of corny dialogue and preposterous moments 
Needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about 
It is to be ya-ya 
Is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . 
Self-deprecating comedy 
That makes it attractive throughout 
The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
Wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life 
's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts 
Is really frustratingly timid and soggy 
Even better than the fellowship 
In formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast 
By this tired retread 
A give-me-an-oscar kind 
Is prime escapist fare . 
First-rate performance 
Sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up

As the mediterranean sparkles , ` swept away ' sinks .

Opera on film is never satisfactory .

One of the most entertaining monster movies in ages 
Very compelling tale 
Distasteful and

Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
Laughter and self-exploitation 
Mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
A smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : 
Disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and 
Exceptionally dreary and overwrought 
A coming-of-age tale 
, vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
Maintains an appealing veneer 
Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
Had just typed ` chris rock , ' ` anthony hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some univac-like script machine 
Interesting in unfaithful 
Is such a sweet and sexy film 
Probably one of the best since the last waltz 
Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold 
The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
It feels like a glossy rehash . 
Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama 
The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
Re-fried green tomatoes 
Keep the story compelling

Overexposed waste 
Demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself

Sorority boys is a bowser . 
There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening

There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes 
The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling

Stunning technical achievement 
It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .

A wonderful film to bring to imax 
An intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch .

Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , 
Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .

Moments of promise 
Slow down 
, despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes ,

A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
's not nearly enough 
Scoring 
Has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest

A workable primer 
The leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , 
Slob 
Keeping the picture compelling 
Too busy 
A terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery 
This is as lax and limp a comedy as i 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
Try to avoid 
So impersonal 
Has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans ' saga of hollywood excess 
Has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics

Enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little 
Powerful sequel 
The sulking , moody male hustler 
Without being forceful , sad without being shrill 
In bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee 
Is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , 
Mob 
Bad blend 
Without much interest in the elizabethans 
The rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- 
A gobbler like this 
Fairly uneventful and 
Kathy baker 's creepy turn 
Writer-director douglas mcgrath 's even-toned direction 
Too stagey , 
A wildly inventive mixture 
Into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness 
Recycled more times 
Stunt-hungry dimwits 
Someone understands the need for the bad boy 
Demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces . 
Thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that ( jaglom ) pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice . 
's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture 
Smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes 
Worst elements 
Is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded 
Do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material . 
The cartoonish clich��s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type 
Creatively stillborn 
Horrified 
Be played out in any working class community in the nation 
Cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional 
The most frantic , virulent and foul-natured 
Elevate `` glory '' 
The metaphors are provocative , 
Drek 
To be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama 
A low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction 
Are also some startling , surrealistic moments 
Weirdly beautiful place 
's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff 
Is definitely worth seeing . 
Too much like a fragment of an underdone potato 
Painfully bad 
Was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles 
Decent but dull . 
For the playlist 
Tells a fascinating , compelling story . 
Stale and clich��d to a fault . 
Is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs 
Far-flung , illogical , and 
Prepare to marvel again 
Uneven movie 
Delightful work 
Brought something fresher to the proceedings 
Is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans 
Worthy 
Your idea of a good time 
It is n't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure ! 
The ridiculous bolero 
A sugar-coated rocky 
A snail 's pace 
It does mark ms. bullock 's best work in some time 
Emotional heart 
Every cheesy scene 
Supposedly , pokemon ca n't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over 
Genial is the conceit , 
's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe 
A second chance to find love in the most unlikely place 
His characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- 
The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there 's very little hustling on view . 
You feel good , you feel sad 
A lot of charm 
A visionary 
Short on larger moralistic consequences 
As dreadful 
Does n't make any sense 
... enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
With originality 
Flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
Pathetic junk 
You might as well be watching it through a telescope 
Are natural and lovely 
Laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor 
Absorbing , 
A powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s . 
Feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . 
There surrender $ 9 
Is , however , 
It 's tough to watch 
An inhalant blackout 
A first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film . 
, worse yet , nonexistent -- 
In visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
Smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
Dreaming up romantic comedies 
It would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality 
With a tale full of nuance and character dimension 
Is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation 
Otherwise dull 
Smart and 
, but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity 
Deviant 
You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
May , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick 
He 's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful . 
Do it his own way 
The film never recovers from the clumsy clich�� of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms. paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
Found writer-director mitch davis 's wall of kitsch hard going 
Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers 
It 's still a comic book , 
What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this 
Whose cumulative effect is chilling 
Have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again 
The director at his most sparkling 
A fine cast 
Suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
Tendency 
Without shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
Quite good 
Feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
It transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film 
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , 
The sad cad that really gives the film its oomph 
Talent and wit 
Savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed 
As it is repetitious 
A fresh point of view 
A film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth 
A weepy melodrama 
Its initial excitement 
That efforts toward closure only open new wounds 
Of holes and completely lacking in chills 
Can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline 
Masterpeice 
Wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear 
That will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long 
Part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humor and lightness . 
Its effectiveness 
Its funny , moving yarn 
Is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
A compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish 
Most mornings 
At the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i 
You feel pissed off 
Version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip 
Wan 
And well-made entertainment 
Heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start 
's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
Honesty and dignity 
Deep vein 
There 's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot 
The screenplay falls somewhat short 
Misguided 
Highly watchable , giggly little story 
Repulsive and 
A ragbag 
What it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
Is a little scattered -- ditsy 
A step further , richer and deeper 
Himself a deft pace master and stylist 
To balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching 
Smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like 
That birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while 
Its sweeping battle scenes 
Reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- 
Pan nalin 's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic 
Flawed but 
Disappoint 
Enhancing 
One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout 
Flowering 
Is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings 
Well-formed satire 
With considerable appeal 
By the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent 
E.t. is still a cinematic touchstone . 
The great pity 
Sing beautifully and act adequately . 
For damon/bourne or his predicament 
These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field 
In a superficial way , while never sure 
Any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future 
Greatest pictures 
What makes the movie fresh 
In a giant pile of elephant feces 
Crafted an engaging fantasy of flavors and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book 
Is beyond playing fair with the audience 
Something 's horribly wrong 
This gets us in trouble 
Should pay reparations to viewers . 
, byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
Know that i 'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again 
What a great way to spend 4 units of your day . 
1987
No more 
Elevated by michael caine 's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world 
A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow 
Plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 
Yarn-spinner 
's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it 
The biggest names in japanese anime , 
Easy , cynical potshots 
Shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions 
A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
The filmmaking may be a bit disjointed 
Through love 
The values of knowledge , education , and the 
Attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel 
I like this movie a lot . 
Mystic 
It can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
The idea of exploiting molestation for laughs 
Neil burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present 
The movie is a desperate miscalculation . 
A psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian ... life . 
A battle between bug-eye theater and dead-eye matinee . 
Avert our eyes 
Assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height 
Asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
Temperamental child 
Presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m��tier 
Energy it 's documenting 
Precisely 
I 'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up . 
Curious 
Grisly and engagingly quixotic 
Reached its expiration date 
Offering next to little insight 
Be lulled into a coma 
's certainly an honest attempt to get at something 
Is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
Should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters 
A brilliant piece of filmmaking 
, this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
Supermarket tabloids 
Pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better 
Does n't remake andrei tarkovsky 's solaris so much as distill it . 
Dead-end 
Rough-trade homo-eroticism 
A very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles . 
( macdowell ) ventures beyond her abilities 
Unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism 
Could rent the original and get the same love story and parable 
Toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater 
Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations 
Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle 
Tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus 
Sensual delights and simmering 
Their natural instinct for self-preservation 
What bubbles up out of john c. walsh 's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie 
On the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged 
Only makeup-deep 
Its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen 
Is unfocused , 
In the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
` martin lawrence live ' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
Touching 
More like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story 
With this masterful , flawless film , ( wang ) emerges in the front ranks of china 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers . 
Has made tucker a star 
Just offbeat 
Own cuteness 
Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point 
Leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an 
The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters . 
Uptight , middle 
An incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief 
That you had already seen that movie 
Layers 
We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and 
, pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
Full , chilling advantage 
Better than the fiction 
Deserves to be seen everywhere 
This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
For every taste 
Meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
A smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
Pack some serious suspense 
Viewers of barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle 
... has a pleasing way with a metaphor . 
Is superficial 
Is a movie you can trust . 
Succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
Unstoppable 
This is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out 
The fun of toy story 2 
In the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni 's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
Honest performances 
Hole-ridden 
Who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix 
Is pleasant enough 
... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
Geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man 
A droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state 
Does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
The fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react 
A worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
Of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes 
The results are far more alienating than involving . 
A hit 
Sit in neutral 
Ultimately hollow mockumentary 
Irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere 
Radical '' or `` suck '' 
Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
Call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace 
The one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded 
Of a brutal mid 
It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but 
The characters seem one-dimensional , and 
Fun part 
Imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful 
Beautifully read and , finally , 
It 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
... visually striking and slickly staged 
Is hereby given fair warning . 
Morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images 
, crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction . 
Unblinkingly pure as the hours 
Feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
With cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
Cho 's latest comic set is n't as sharp or as fresh as i 'm the one that i want ... but it 's still damn funny stuff . 
A processed comedy chop suey . 
Manages to escape the shackles of its own clich��s to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks 
Did not figure out a coherent game 
, every shot enhances the excellent performances 
The actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
Is so different from the apple and so striking 
Is all too predictable and far too cliched 
Hate 
We 've seen it all before in one form or another , 
A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro 
It 's a very valuable film ... 
Rashomon-for-dipsticks 
Insane comic undertaking 
Clear sense 
Performance - ahem 
Fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 
The worthy successor to a better tomorrow and 
So successful at lodging itself in the brain 
Wickedly funny and just plain wicked 
... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . 
Can be a bit repetitive 
Deliberate laughs 
Possibly the best actor working in movies today 
No charm , no laughs , no fun , 
Perfectly formed 
Appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction 
That does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them 
's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
Is hypnotic 
( shyamalan ) continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
Starving and 
, charismatic and tragically 
Of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy 
Wit or innovation 
That only seems to care about the bottom line 
The beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing . 
Come away from his film overwhelmed , 
The determination of pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop . 
He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
Combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that 's not merely about kicking undead *** , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption 
A stirring road movie . 
Certain 
A lumbering load 
If you 're up for that sort of thing 
There are a couple of things that elevate `` glory '' above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
Would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed ` the french lieutenant 's woman . ' 
They lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail . 
Consumed and forgotten 
After drinking twelve beers 
It amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film 
A big fat pain . 
Need of a scented bath 
That has no point and goes nowhere 
Their enthusiasm 
Be very sweet 
Smarter and subtler 
`` the best disney movie 
A sour little movie 
A film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
A showcase 
A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
Stands as one of the great films about movie love 
Grant is certainly amusing 
A genial romance 
Unimaginative and derivative 
The cheap 
A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
Full-bodied wit 
Modestly made 
You may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes wo n't still be tapping . 
The creative act 
Bravura 
So real 
Despite its shortcomings , girls ca n't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it 's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
Is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters 
It just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
' should never have been brought out of hibernation 
Trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein 's brain . 
Dreary expanse 
A relationship that is worthy of our respect 
The updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett 's story is appealing . 
's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm 's shelf 
Astoundingly rich 
, there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy 
Devotees 
By amateurish 
Feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow 
About whose fate it is hard to care 
Just another teen movie , 
Pitifully few real laughs 
, double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action 
Has done excellent work here 
Defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second 
` it 's just a kids ' flick 
Evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction 
Better characters 
Few nonbelievers 
Simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
The funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was 
There is precious little of either . 
You 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie 
Feels at odds with the rest of the film . 
Plan to make enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' 
In kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast 
Weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise 
Fuelled devito 's early work 
Make up for a derivative plot 
To be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident 
Is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
A real charmer 
Convinced 
As a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points 
Elegant 
Short of true inspiration 
Whimsy 
One decent performance 
Really solid performances 
In and of himself funny 
Like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right . 
Wins still 
Insipid , brutally clueless film 
Refreshingly natural 
That it comes off as annoying rather than charming 
Frame one 
The problems of fledgling democracies 
For all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters 
I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener 
Manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography 
The love of family 
It 's unnerving suspense 
Think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch . 
With more emotional force than any other recent film 
The bread , 
Best comedy concert movie 
A cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 
An unsympathetic character and someone 
Is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers 
Shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team 
Parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
Flawless 
Headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito 
American blockbusters 
Too long 
Lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction 
Secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
Puzzling than unsettling 
A surprisingly funny movie . 
The edge of sanity 
With roussillon providing comic relief 
Perceptive , good-natured 
Stock situations and characters 
Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
Increasingly diverse 
Stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr. drew barrymore . 
Tsai ming-liang 's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? 
Enjoy the film 
An insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer 
Wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
Nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly 
Engages us in constant fits of laughter , 
Imaginative as one might have hoped 
Duly impressive in imax dimensions 
That fails to make adequate 
Compelling film . 
He 's not good with people . 
Might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
World-renowned 
Hollywood frightfest 
To treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation 
, you 're engulfed by it . 
Pushed into the margins 
Doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents 
A vision both painterly and literary 
Rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations 
Quick-witted 
Killer 
Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes 
High drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky 
Something different 
, unlikeable people 
A journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it 's potentially just as rewarding 
, crisp storytelling 
Do the genial-rogue shtick to death 
Revelatory and narcissistic 
Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
Like they were lifted from terry gilliam 's subconscious , pressed through kafka 's meat grinder and into bu?uel 's casings 
There are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable 
To refresh our souls 
Is one of those rare pictures 
Emotionally desiccated 
When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller 
An unsophisticated 
Is n't much to it 
Overboard 
Zoe clarke-williams 's lackluster thriller `` new best friend '' , 
Magnetic performance 
First full flush 
When compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 
Its courage , ideas , 
Is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' pg-13 rating 
Are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
Enormously entertaining movie 
, occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film 
By a lackluster script and substandard performances 
Stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold 
Failing , ultimately 
Woefully dull 
In the business 
Real snooze . 
Far more energy 
Wilde 's droll whimsy 
Of the great minds of our times 
One arresting image 
What makes it worth the trip to the theater 
Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time 
Absurd , 
Emotional comfort 
Been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip 
Stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor 
All the wiggling energy 
Is his best film yet 
Back with the astonishing revelation 
Dragged on 
A moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
Forgettably 
Your indifference 
Obnoxious comedy 
A sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as 
, lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
Nothing about this movie 
Leaves blue crush waterlogged 
As the synergistic impulse that created it 
Hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic ... 
It 's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness 
's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead 
Attractive and talented actors 
Is rotten in the state of california 
Lurches between not-very-funny comedy 
Jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , 
A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
A grating , 
Poignant and delicately complex . 
The wise , wizened visitor 
Wit and dignity 
A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture 
What 's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito 's misanthropic vision 
Lovely and beautifully 
Be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act 
So much leniency 
Simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails 
Good idea 
A very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
, you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
Had all its vital essence scooped out and 
You 're a comic fan 
Way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time 
Up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking 
Conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
So meditative and lyrical about babak payami 's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
No special effects , and no hollywood endings 
The more hackneyed elements of the film 
Hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie 
Energy and imagination 
Melodramatic paranormal romance 
Another smash 
Whiny pouty-lipped poof 
More tiring than anything 
Is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit . 
Special 
Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , 
It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ... 
Horror 
Dicaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year 
Paints - of a culture in conflict with itself 
Between the artificial structure 
The mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway 
Heartwarming yarn 
Like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you ca n't fake . 
Intensely romantic 
The more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects 
Three splendid actors 
Is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace 
A fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film 's ability to make its subject interesting to those who are n't part of its supposed target audience . 
Thoroughly enjoyable 
An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series 
The cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
To `` interesting '' 
Reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style 
Fine-looking 
Losin ' his fan base 
Marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it 
Engrossing story 
( the leads ) are such a companionable couple 
Make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book 
You should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . 
Buoyant , expressive 
Watch the film twice 
An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art . 
Loopy and 
A touching reflection 
While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . ' 
A clever script and skilled actors 
This flat effort 
Watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
( gulpilil ) is a commanding screen presence , and 
Who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia 
Have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense 
That sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theater 
The most edgy piece of disney animation 
In the right place 
Really get weird , though not particularly scary 
Sweet , even delectable 
As part of mr. dong 's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair . 
Performances , great to look at , and funny 
It never comes close to being either funny or scary 
Predictable rehash 
A movie of technical skill and rare depth 
The sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny 
So cold and dead 
Of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs 
, soar . 
Made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience 
Politics , power and 
Too erotic nor 
Is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking 
Stupid 
Is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers . 
Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
Wondering why these people mattered 
The titillating material 
Infidelity 
Enjoyably 
No good answer to that one 
Be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
's pure entertainment 
To pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
Grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
Is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence 
Though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich�� . 
Constantly touching 
Having a nightmare about bad cinema 
Bratty for sympathy 
An entertaining documentary 
Striking , quietly vulnerable personality 
Worse than you can imagine 
Compassion , good-natured 
That takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
Deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still 
Is japanese and yet feels universal 
Most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors 
From its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale 
Is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence 
A good movie ye 
This nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
Just do n't work in concert . 
It wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain 
Finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
Of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this 
The whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
Cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 
A weird , arresting little ride . 
Much more than 
Really goes downhill . 
A wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
Ms. sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine 
Any art-house moviegoer 
More than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it . 
Their story is predictable 
Humorless 
Misses 
Ingenue 
From a bad clive barker movie 
Does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and 
An unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . 
The characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones 
Will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic 
Ultimately purposeless 
Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
More intimate than spectacular , e.t. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
One of the funniest motion 
Remake andrei tarkovsky 's solaris so much as distill it 
As unblinkingly pure as the hours 
` scratch ' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
Half-hearted 
Padded 
Walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity 
Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat 
A dime 
Kiddie fantasy pablum 
Of overwhelming waste 
By the pathetic idea 
Airy cinematic bon bons 
Sure to ultimately disappoint the action 
's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull 
In its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism 
Stunning 
Dripping with cliche 
Warm as it is wise 
, the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability 
The film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original , but 
Wewannour money back , 
As it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
A chance to learn , to grow , to travel 
Woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . 
Volletta wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness 
Sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature 
Warm and well-told 
What 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling 
Mired in tear-drenched quicksand 
That is actually funny with the material 
Narrative continuity 
Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin 
Not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , 
A canny crowd pleaser , and 
A film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern 
So watchable 
Stunning animation 
The dog from snatch ) 
Great marching bands 
Absolutely amazing 
Cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
Successful 
No reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining 
Esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
The touch is generally light enough and 
Unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear 
Plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither 
Has some nice twists but the ending 
Washington has a sure hand . 
A boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
Very good film 
More curious 
Liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive 
Less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
Ace japanimator hayao miyazaki 's spirited away 
Few movies have ever approached 
A thoroughly awful movie -- 
Springing 
Bigger than yourself 
The plot is nothing but boilerplate clich��s from start to finish , and 
A wonderful account to work from 
There is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
Turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . 
Lil bow wow takes the cake 
Dismally dull sci-fi comedy 
Denouement 
Still want my money back . 
Has a tired , talky feel . 
And the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . 
From japan 
Knows how a daily grind can kill love 
An admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of don simpson . 
It aims so low 
Eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
Told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
Big , dumb action movie 
Lip-reading 
Audacity and openness 
Enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies 
One of the year 's most enjoyable releases 
To like 
A cellophane-pop remake of the punk 
Morally bankrupt characters 
, overall it 's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
You 're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does n't have big screen magic . 
Exhilarating documentary 
Intentionally low 
Creepy crawlies 
Loud , witless mess 
To accomplish 
When cares melted away in the dark theater 
As quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 
A dud 
Sappy situations and dialogue 
Entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment 
Adorably whimsical comedy 
The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs 
It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
Expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness 
How pertinent its dynamics remain 
Includes too much obvious padding . 
Becomes predictably conventional 
The plot is nothing but boilerplate clich��s from start to finish 
A straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
A story for more than four minutes 
Hip-hop indie snipes 
Trifling 
May be the performances of their careers 
From a faraway planet 
One of the most repellent things 
Would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
Tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship 
A powerful sequel and one 
Ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , 
Uproarious humor 
Deft punctuation 
It 's sweet and fluffy at the time 
Reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon 
Is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies . 
It allows the mind to enter and accept another world 
Could as easily have been called ` under siege 3 : in alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life 
Laugh because he acts so goofy all the time 
Oversexed 
It gets old quickly . 
Peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth 
The four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
Few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and 
Of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design 
Forefront 
Be most in the mind of the killer 
Stages his gags as assaults on america 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony 
A celebration 
You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
Flat and uncreative 
Oo many of these gross 
Like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish 
I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
A lot like a well-made pb & j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same 
Frailty fascinates 
A play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome 
The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson ... 
Remains brightly optimistic 
Worth your time 
Rooting for the monsters in a horror movie 
Still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable 
, everything else about the film tanks . 
As overbearing and over-the-top as the family 
It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman 
A subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable 
, shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . 
A bland murder-on-campus 
The artwork 
A remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic 
, the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 
Even the corniest 
... a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job ... 
Has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs 
Its beautiful women 
Wretchedly 
You have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow 
Clever scripting solutions 
Left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte 's web of desire and desperation . 
Late fees 
Is uniformly superb 
Fails at both endeavors 
Convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking 
Siren 
To be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something 
From a bygone era 
, the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you ca n't fake . 
One of french cinema 's master craftsmen 
A funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
Suspenseful clich�� 
During the tuxedo 's 90 minutes of screen time , there is n't one true ` chan moment ' . 
Should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn 
Most virtuous limits 
Something goes bump in the night and nobody cares 
Puzzle his most ardent fans . 
A bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them 
To our basest desires 
A black hole 
A worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions 
Comic energy 
The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure 
Excites the imagination 
Inauthentic at its core 
Remain an unchanged dullard 
If i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was 
A vivid , spicy footnote to history , 
A suspenseful spin 
Of an underdone potato 
Get more re-creations of all those famous moments 
Real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires 
The gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . 
Good guys 
It sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
Very expressive 
Arliss howard 's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , 
Said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women 
A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
Ghastly 
A nightmare about bad cinema 
, gangs excels in spectacle and pacing . 
The film operates nicely off the element of surprise 
How love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew 
To overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot 
The third feels limited by its short running time 
Medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . 
That , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in 
It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery 
Going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year 
, by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care 
Berling and b��art ... continue to impress , 
, comfortable 
Gets old 
As solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die 
Of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life 
For something new 
Reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , 
Simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
When none of them are ever any good 
Tired , talky 
's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages . 
Moonlight mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy 
Engaging simplicity 
Strong and convincing 
'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment 
An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them . 
For sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics 
But the actors make this worth a peek . 
A crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one 
Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
's the butt of its own joke 
A masterpiece -- 
A dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder 
A stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force 
Clich��s and mawkish dialogue 
A tragic dimension and 
Deathly slow to any teen 
Annoyed 
Any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling 
Maybe twice ) 
Good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . 
Remarkably unpretentious 
Has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke . 
Funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful 
It is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
That crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album 
A work of extraordinary journalism , but 
Worked against the maker 's minimalist intent 
Spirals downward , and 
Second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds 
Full 
It goes further than both 
More than a whiff 
More to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
K-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 
Because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him 
Generic thriller junk . 
No fun 
Joyous communal festival 
A simple premise 
You would n't turn down a big bowl of that 
Fearlessly 
That never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy 
Probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . 
A delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet 
The film 's lack of personality 
Subtly kinky bedside vigils and 
Auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance 
Hard to resist . 
Bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story 
More than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex 
Of purpose and even-handedness 
Any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms. spears 
The film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
Are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma 
, the film does hold up pretty well . 
One ca n't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album . 
Yet surprisingly entertaining 
Some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
Amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it . 
Of a sleeper success 
Being real 
That made a walk to remember a niche hit 
Rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season 
At once visceral and spiritual , 
Each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness 
Overstays 
As an actor 's showcase 
Dressed up this little parable 
An aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing 
The nerve-raked acting , 
Top-notch action powers this romantic drama 
Is n't merely offensive 
Unlikable 
... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did i miss something ? '' 
Without any of the pretension associated with the term 
Rent those movies instead , 
Is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever 
Vulgar , sexist 
Very difficult 
Is so incredibly inane 
Brash and mainly unfunny 
Convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers 
Directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
Ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way 
Misconceived final 
Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
Journey into a philosophical void 
The story really has no place to go since simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict . 
Where their heads were is anyone 's guess . 
Humor and a heartfelt conviction 
For the best 
Of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence 
Bug-eyed mugging 
Two dimension tale 
Friends will be friends through thick and thin 
Sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
If good-hearted , movie . 
The characters are intriguing and realistic 
Realism , crisp storytelling and 
Actually seem to understand what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring 
Created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point 
Unflappable 
Traditional romantic 
Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
A hack script 
A tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers . 
Just does n't have anything really interesting to say . 
Going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud 
Lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
And lesbian children 
Study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
Unimpressively 
It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; 
Is an impossible task 
The hours , a delicately crafted film 
The metaphors are provocative 
It puts washington , as honest working man john q. archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
Super-dooper-adorability intact 
Been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy 
Are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
Reassures 
Of america , history and the awkwardness of human life 
There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
The four feathers is definitely horse feathers , 
An intricate , intimate and intelligent journey 
Beautifully designed 
Even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
Thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , 
Paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
Genuinely unnerving . 
And movie life 
Effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself 
Some comic sparks 
Subtle , and resonant 
Though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
Bracingly nasty 
A smart , nuanced look at de sade and 
Grows on you . 
And for many of us , that 's good enough . 
Unparalleled 
Trapped wo n't score points for political correctness 
Love robin tunney 
Cold , gray , antiseptic and 
Who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny 
Its own 
And sublime music 
A treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score 
The kind of social texture and realism 
Astoundingly 
Drag 
'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
Humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life 
Good one 
Abandoned , 
Is better than ` shindler 's list ' 
This sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . 
Has a feel for the character at all stages of her life 
Dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams 
Refreshes 
Inconsistencies 
Something creepy about this movie 
A filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him 
Engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese ` cultural revolution . 
Suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused 
The yawning chasm where the plot should be 
Maudlin focus 
Blazingly 
Owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama 
A film living far too much in its own head 
Make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film 
, this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
, talented , charismatic and tragically 
Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia 's true emotions ... but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
A feature debut 
Sumptuous ocean visuals 
Bitterly 
Watch witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama 
Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you 
When the explosions start , they fall to pieces 
All your mateys , 
The structure is simple , but 
The stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject 
Could not stand them 
That nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride 
Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
Groaner 
Strange and beautiful film 
Tired , unnecessary 
Artistic transcendence 
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't 
For older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
A sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one 's mother 
Its absurdities and crudities 
Are beautifully 
Do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages 
No disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer 
Feature-length stretch 
Could have turned this into an argentine retread of `` iris '' or `` american beauty , '' but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films 
's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` dragonfly . '' 
Ok for a movie 
Surprisingly entertaining 
An instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick . 
, think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
Keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character 's gripping humanity 
Is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony 
Some intelligent observations 
The consequences 
Be interested in knowing any of them personally 
Rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent 
Against a tree 
Have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
No amount of imagination 
More salacious telenovela than serious drama 
Placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil ,

Squeeze the action and our emotions 
And narrative flow 
This seductive tease 
This gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
A serious debt to the road warrior 
The wasted potential of this slapstick comedy 
That its own action is n't very effective 
, noisy and pretentious 
A genuinely bone-chilling tale 
One the public 
But it 's worth the concentration . 
Part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin 
, they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
He waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading 
A worthy idea 
Of the little mermaid and aladdin 
The line between sappy and sanguine 
Believable that you feel what they feel 
That were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities 
Realize your mind is being blown 
Such an achievement 
Engaging diatribes 
Its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images 
The obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 
Nostalgic comments 
Is definitely a director to watch 
Some laughs 
See this terrific film 
An oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion 
Too amateurish and awkward 
Although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey 
For leonard 
Clich��s , depression and 
An unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters 
Avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching 
A classic text 
Sheridan had a wonderful account to work from 
It also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us 
Waldo salt screenwriting award 
No. 1 
A fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame 
So much phone in his performance as 
You want to see it 
What a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be 
Hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff 
One of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i 've had in a while 
Although estela bravo 's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro 
With table manners 
Illuminating 
With a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life 
Deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer 
Remarkably insightful 
Actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue 
Continues to do interesting work 
Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction 
Low-budget series 
Give them credit for : the message of the movie 
Parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 
Shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
Be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span 
Is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
Great monster movie 
Famed 
The story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing 
Populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes 
Will likely enjoy this monster 
Gives out 
That i ca n't wait to see what the director does next 
A genuine and singular artist 
Joyful solo performance 
A customarily jovial air 
A joyous communal festival of rhythm 
Have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat 
Inherent absurdity 
Of common sense 
How its makers actually seem to understand what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring 
The campaign-trail press 
The opera 's drama and lyricism 
The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get 
A sense of real magic , perhaps 
Is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
( johnnie to and wai ka fai are ) sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
Was longer than an hour 
The problem with all of this 
Suitably kooky which should appeal to women 
A hard look at one man 's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
An honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view 
As a vehicle to savor binoche 's skill 
Recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
This modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
Amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film 
Of thoughtful war films and those 
Is really , really stupid 
Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor 
Suicidal 
Empathy 
Of male hustlers 
Intelligent and moving 
Cinematic perfection 
In more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
Directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory 
Hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and 
Catch this imax offering 
Fears 
A moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
An inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot 
Succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , 
As a souffl�� gone wrong 
Spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do 
Is sordid and disgusting . 
Also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness 
The comic elements of the premise 
The filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice 
In an attempt 
The basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
The fine line between cheese 
Right down the reality drain 
By a legacy of abuse 
Like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming 
Weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism 
A pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
Makes for a touching love story 
Makes its message resonate 
Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs. sever , were made for the palm screen . 
Tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience . 
Got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation 
Made a movie that is n't just offensive 
Leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites 
The courage of new york 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief 
To hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over 
A classic 
The plot weaves us into a complex web . 
Humor 
Enough to sustain laughs 
Implausible 
Come when various characters express their quirky inner selves 
A strong script 
Ver wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
Filmed on the set of carpenter 's the thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat 
Knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying 
A delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite 
Thoroughly engrossing and 
A vibrant whirlwind 
Of the very best movies 
Its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart . 
Affable 
A thirteen-year-old 's book report 
In which the kids in the house will be gored 
A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
The charming result is festival in cannes . 
The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
Turgid 
Been recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
On the edge of your seat 
Most third-rate horror sequels 
Labored and unfunny 
A boring movie 
This rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach ` ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines . 
Even more indistinct 
Aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit 
Time , death 
The affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez 's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm 
's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt 's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
Dull , unimaginative 
From its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
, amari 's film falls short in building the drama of lilia 's journey . 
, it 's not too bad . 
Cute alien 
Fetid underbelly 
An eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
The bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they 've told a nice little story in the process 
A flat script 
A properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
Sentimental , hypocritical 
Carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy 
Splendor 
Does n't add up . 
, you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
This engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called ` the gift of tears 
Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished 
Goldie hawn 
A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery 
As long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? 
Wonder , hope and magic 
The primitive murderer 
The journey feel like a party 
Feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks . 
In narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood 
The film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
Is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor 
Less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series 
Bore . 
's not as single-minded as john carpenter 's original 
That the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
The predictability 
Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
Snappy 
Grows thin soon 
This is a heartfelt story ... 
Add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
The poor and the dispossessed 
Favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness 
That movie nothing 
Contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
Mysterious , sensual , 
Nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a 
Of elaborate and twisted characters 
It awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters 
A surprising , subtle turn at the midway point 
Hate myself 
Such a talented director as chen kaige 
The most oddly honest hollywood document 
Of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing 
Be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame 
Is a fragmented film , 
Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is 
A smart little indie . 
Tv sitcom material 
Is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami 's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
Weaves us into a complex web . 
The script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes 
Is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' pg-13 rating . 
Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
Enjoyed it 
Like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation 
A bad movie , just mediocre 
On other levels 
Is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor 
Master craftsmen 
Can detract from the affection of that moral favorite 
A remarkable film by bernard rose 
, do n't bother . 
Long , 
The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
High romance , brought off with considerable wit 
Just plain bad . 
Completely awful 
( fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall ) 
Morvern rocks . 
Love stories you will ever see 
Offers nothing 
Intimidated by both her subject matter and 
Totally unnecessary prologue 
Herzog has fallen 
Sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices 
's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship 
And people make fun of me for liking showgirls . 
The kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine 
Silly , stupid and pointless 
Is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
A tribute to the power of women to heal 
Though jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape 
Present an unflinching look at one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness 
... irritating soul-searching garbage . 
With an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable `` formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , 
An unusual but pleasantly haunting debut 
Naivet�� and 
Suspense , surprise and 
Coming through in the end 
Devoid of wit and humor 
Like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry 
A brazenly misguided project 
Those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today 
Make `` the good girl '' a film worth watching 
Developed characters 
With the transparent attempts at moralizing 
A singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
Is visually dazzling 
To distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies 
Give a spark to `` chasing amy '' and `` changing lanes '' falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` 
Steadfast 
Rare drama 
Hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span 
That leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending 
Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished . 
Too clich��d and too often strains credulity 
For attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks 
Once again he has n't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film 
Possibly the sturdiest example yet 
This movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship 's heart 
Feel like a 10-course banquet . 
Boilerplate clich��s 
Is ) a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
Observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism 
At best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
The gross-out comedy 
Interesting and at times captivating 
Delightfully rendered 
Chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back 
Tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit 
Offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory 
Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . 
Be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture 
The charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film 's problems . 
Carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
Will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen george roy hill 's 1973 film , `` the sting . 
In the annals of cinema 
Completely awful iranian drama ... 
Be ( assayas ' ) homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality 
To shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff 
Peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper 
In a new way 
One of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of 
Mean 
Noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching 
're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans 
This nonsensical story 
Have a sense of humor 
See the attraction for the sole reason 
That most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad 
This unrelenting bleak insistence 
An mtv , sugar hysteria 
Live a rich and full life 
A sloppy , amusing comedy 
For a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears 
There 's no art here 
Originality ai n't on the menu ,

Plain dumb 
An allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick 
Wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , 
Elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with washington the actor 
Unspeakably , 
`` goddammit 
It feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
It 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . 
Reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism 
Cool 
Is n't really one of resources 
Have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
Is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations 
're more likely to enjoy on a computer 
Dredge up 
A gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary 
Cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and 
, no matter how degraded things get . 
Adventurous young talent 
If stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks 
Not to have been edited at all 
's so successful at lodging itself in the brain 
It 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life 
Work as shallow entertainment , 
Familiar and tired 
'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair 
With results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and 
They 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort 
Rambling and incoherent manifesto 
Better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style 
Greatest 
Great fun 
Life-affirming moments 
The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
An intimacy 
The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
Lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious 
Interestingly 
Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
Unencouraging threefold expansion 
Harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
Crowd-pleaser 
Is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
From grace that still leaves shockwaves 
Bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen 
To little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff 
Does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
So sloppy 
Stylishly directed with verve 
Terrific performances , great to look at , and funny 
A good-natured ensemble comedy 
It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
Damned compelling 
A star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
Roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
A sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter 
Of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images 
Is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts 
, absurd , 
May find it uninteresting 
Some very good acting , 
It overstays its natural running time 
Skillfully 
A riveting profile 
Most repugnant adaptation 
The humans are acting like puppets 
You 're enlightened by any of derrida 's 
Stale , futile scenario 
Hungry-man portions of bad ' 
In a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling 
There 's nothing resembling a spine here

In a vibrant and intoxicating fashion 
Jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
A compelling french psychological drama 
Captivating coming-of-age story

The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence 
More than a tepid 
, it might just be the movie you 're looking for . 
The events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
There 's nothing very attractive about this movie 
Got a place in your heart 
Delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
Wo n't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies

Expect from movies 
A compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 
Has a number of holes 
Is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
Philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron 
The film should instead be called ` my husband is travis bickle ' 
Builds its multi-character story with a flourish 
Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly 
Solidly entertaining 
Consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment 
Humanizing 
A torn book jacket 
A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period

To paraphrase a line from another dickens ' novel 
Its rough edges 
Has plenty of laughs 
As imperious

Is as delightful as it is derivative . 
Turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts 
Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
Staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby 
Is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack 
With raw urban humor 
Incredible 
Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge 
Match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 
Has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults 
Worthy successor 
Genteel and 
Is an interesting movie 
Often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it 's very much like life itself . 
Putrid 
A casual intelligence 
Well-conceived 
Overall feelings , broader ideas ,

The movie 's messages are quite admirable , 
Too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary 
A gentle film 
A new treasure 
Emphasizes the well-wrought story 
Forced 
Lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences 
Epiphanies 
Sweet and sexy film 
Infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane . 
Derived from a lobotomy 
It squanders chan 's uniqueness ;

At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
A cutesy romantic tale with a twist 
Has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted 
Is an inspirational love story 
Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
Why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is

The unsalvageability 
Kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party 
That are damned in queen of the damned 
It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert 
A gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life

Amazingly 
Cold porridge 
Witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . 
They 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
This is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
A total rehash 
Turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing 
Insightful and entertaining 
A bland , pretentious mess . 
Subtle ironies 
Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it is n't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers 
Even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic 
It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
Drags the film down .

When he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable

Car to drive through 
A funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast 
Better film 
Little farm melodrama . 
Tight 
I firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . 
's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity 
The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept 
Think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
The real issues 
Developed with more care 
It lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho . 
A visionary marvel , but it 's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
Similarly themed

With a flimsy ending 
Outlandish 
Into forced fuzziness 
Will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .

How resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and 
The chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .

Nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .

A gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say

Unwavering and arresting 
An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendor that can be seen in other films

The movie would seem less of a trifle if ms. sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .

Too much resonance

Boring man 
Mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life

Is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
There are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies . 
The bourne identity should n't be half as entertaining as it is , but 
Stuffy and 
Is too blatant 
Potent chemistry 
Ash wednesday is not edward burns ' best film 
Is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line 
More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine 
A delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy 
's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
Riveting and handsomely 
Will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution 
, comedy and romance 
Of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless 
Express warmth and longing 
Takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms 
The utter cuteness of stuart and margolo 
Honest poetry 
Of intoxicating atmosphere and little else 
Nervy and 
Is compelling enough , 
Humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast 
Throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto 
Color and depth , 
Fun-seeking summer audiences 
That it ca n't help but engage an audience 
's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction 
Pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice 
This delicate coming-of-age tale 
A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film ... 
Make an excellent companion piece 
Would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
, why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
Too bland and 
Amusing juxtapositions 
's a fun one . 
Is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card 
Wickedly undramatic central theme 
You think , zzzzzzzzz 
Jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
, vaguely silly overkill 
Accident 
It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 
Bad mannered 
On a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi 
The film 's most improbable feat ? 
Deniro 's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk 
For all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son . 
If a bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet 
Darling 
Bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness 
Pleasantly and 
I do n't think this movie loves women at all . 
Is well below expectations 
Fans of critics ' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart . 
Is , we have no idea what in creation is going on 
A good guy 
Sleepless 
Whom the 
Lavish 
Embarrassed 
A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
Is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers 
Omitted nor a clich�� left unsaid 
Poignant comedy 
Its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
Gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre . 
Equally derisive 
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but 
Kindness 
Her childlike smile 
Too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present 
That a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland 
So recognizable and true that , as in real life , we 're never sure how things will work out 
Take you to outer space 
Own tortured psyche 
The modern remake of dumas 's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . 
A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
The pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud 
A film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
Noise , mayhem and stupidity 
To his day job 
What 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn . 
It 's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
, shapeless documentary 
Enjoy on a certain level 
It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . 
It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s 
Of her considerable talents 
Impersonal 
The lack of climax and , worst of all 
Its initial promise 
It 's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . 
Hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous ( than leon ) 
From human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
You feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied 
Does n't take itself so deadly seriously 
Has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement 
Enjoyable documentary . 
Bring something new into the mix 
Intense political and psychological thriller 
It 's up to ( watts ) to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe 
Bracingly truthful antidote 
Interesting bit 
Over-the-top , and 
's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
Hackneyed 
Leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion 
Loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat 
One of the funnier movies 
Is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
Injects just enough freshness into the proceedings 
Making reference to other films and trying to be other films 
Not smart 
Is n't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure ! 
No chemistry or 
An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been 
Lush 
, luridly colored , 
Is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us 
Once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera ... 
A canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss 
This is a movie full of grace and , 
An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total 
A sick and evil woman 
The story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and 
In a thriller , and the performances 
Interesting slice 
Muddled 
Once intimate and universal cinema 
Bo derek made the ridiculous bolero 
Cruel and 
Not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , 
Wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
Would stoop so low 
Somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them 
Passionate 
Devastating , eloquent clarity 
Eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , 
Unpaid intern 
It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished . 
Its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros 
Disconcertingly slack 
Wonderful life 
Distinctly minor effort 
Opposed to the manifesto 
All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` angels with dirty faces ' appeared in 1938 . 
That work -- is charming , is moving 
Bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some 
This u-boat does n't have a captain . 
A convincing one 
Is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
Is n't something to be taken seriously 
Entirely infantile 
For great cinema 
Is a remarkable piece of filmmaking 
Dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important 
Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
Own meager weight 
Easy feel-good sentiments 
A relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill 
A porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) 
Unlikable , uninteresting 
Than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach 
For us 
Too weak 
A funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage `` be careful what you wish for '' 
One funny popcorn 
Warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality 
Deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
Could have been crisper and punchier 
Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
Clearly a manipulative film 
Thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 
Astonishing 
Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
Been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant 
Jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing 
A powerful drama 
Genuinely moving and 
It 's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate 
Is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
Both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable 
Awkward 
Truly distinctive and 
Playful 
Elevates the material above pat inspirational status and 
Offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us 
It 's an utterly static picture 
P.t. anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
More like the pilot episode of a tv series 
Dismissed as mindless 
That 's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
Obvious . 
Very best 
`` being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses 
A children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped 
Muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do n't have , and how this gets us in trouble . 
Goofball action comedy 
To the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and 
It 's crafty , energetic and smart 
Inventive , fun 
All in all , a great party 
Live in if argento 's hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve 
Is all over the place 
's not very good either 
Everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
If you have the patience for it 
Rounded and revealing overview 
It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun 
It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
Clarke-williams 's 
Has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery 
Intimidated by both her subject matter

The journey to the secret 's eventual discovery 
While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out `` when you 're a jet , you 're a jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` tonight . '' 
, with enough negatives 
It 's not a motion picture ; 
To quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles 
With originality , humor and pathos 
, it is worth searching out . 
Overwrought , 
The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of ( godard 's ) vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .

A dim-witted and lazy spin-off 
Thinly sketched story 
This cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f. kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative .

Has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises 
Feels five hours long 
Is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans . 
Hey everybody , wan na watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? 
Mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema

Have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera 
A hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional 
Succeeds in making us believe 
Puts an exclamation point on the fact 
Will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this 
Elephant feces 
It takes your breath away

More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... 
In fast-edit , hopped-up fashion 
Television screen 
For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
The ` true story ' by which all the queen 's men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen 
Without sham the raw-nerved story 
As it is spooky and subtly in love with myth 
Lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
Pretty valuable 
Something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel 
Real-life persona 
Not all of the stories work and the ones that do 
Impart a message 
Hopes mr. plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter 
Baroque beauty 
To occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences

Is a pleasant enough dish . 
This is sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often . 
Lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but 
Satisfying niblet 
There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
I 'm just about ready to go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike 
Then go see this delightful comedy . 
Appropriate 
Should see this movie

Doomed by its smallness 
Does n't reveal even a hint of artifice 
Derive from this choppy and sloppy affair 
Dark-as-pitch 
Some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time 
An incoherent jumble 
To video 
Starts off with a 1950 's doris day feel 
's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
's film ' in the worst sense of the expression 
... a light , yet engrossing piece . 
Miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
The chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms ... 
A highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet edge to it . 
You can release your pent up anger 
Some wickedly sick and twisted humor 
An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound 
A minor treat 
At the peak of their powers 
Most poorly staged and lit action 
Grace and humor 
Of a travesty of a transvestite comedy 
A distinct rarity , and 
A moving , if uneven , success 
... in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
Offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies . 
Unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache 
Your kids

That deserves more than a passing twinkle 
Bold choices

Deeply unpleasant experience 
No apparent reason except 
Tawdry trash 
Eclipses 
Revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film 's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein 's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark 's dogma movement 
Amusing , let alone funny 
A sleeper success 
The worst movie 
Short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil 
What 's the russian word for wow !? ' 
For the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) 
Dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted 
A huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone 
As if drop dead gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
Gedeck , 
Mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another 
Unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance 
Top shelf 
Afraid of the bad reviews 
In this forgettable effort 
Has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making 
What an idea 
Is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , 
The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff�� and demi moore 's the scarlet letter . 
A wet burlap sack 
That the entire exercise has no real point 
Loathsome movie 
Snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza 
The ya-ya sisterhood 
An extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes 
Looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale 
I 'd take ( its ) earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time . 
These women 's souls right open 
A naturally funny film , 
Rich performances 
While general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
Material this rich 
A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst . 
Earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones 
You could change tables 
All sing beautifully and act adequately . 
As thought-provoking 
Up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick 
Ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's 
Of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , 
Appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s the filmmakers could dredge up . 
Pretty decent little documentary 
Often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy 
We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` chris rock , ' ` anthony hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some univac-like script machine 
Hoped i would -- with moist eyes

Warmest 
Manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
Choppy ending 
Spellbinding 
Unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
As simultaneously funny , offbeat 
Entertained 
Cheesy screenplay 
Can smell the grease on the plot 
You 'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids 
A schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely 
Albeit a visually compelling one 
Overly convenient plot twists 
A big-budget/all-star movie 
Just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls . 
That would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book 
Maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , 
That it 's far too sentimental 
That burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him 
Frighteningly fascinating contradiction 
Quality twist 
Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
Anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts 
The salton sea works the way a good noir should 
Golden 
A rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest . 
Pacino is the best he 's been in years 
Goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . 
Demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking 
Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances ... keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 
That things fall apart 
Chilling advantage 
Made a walk to remember a niche hit 
While this film has an ` a ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
Coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs -- 
Unbearably lame .

The problem with movies about angels 
Inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers 
Digital 
Lethargic

Utterly charming 
Two gifted performers

Delivers the same old bad trip 
Sending the audience 
With energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage 
Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
Might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john 
Works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by india 's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
Touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot 
Its ludicrous and contrived plot 
The film is well under way -- 
But what is missing from it all is a moral . 
Grant is n't cary and bullock is n't katherine 
Gripping documentary 
This unimaginative comedian 
Septic 
A keep - 'em - guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
Is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever 
Directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made 
Lets things peter out midway 
As a serious drama about spousal abuse 
Most audacious , outrageous 
To the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) 
, we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching . 
This gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
Is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
Accumulate like lint in a fat man 's navel 
Never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
The wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
Sulky teen drama

Derived from a lobotomy , 
Does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard 
There is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but 
Familiar but utterly delightful . 
Cuba gooding jr. valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy 
Veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements 
There are some laughs in this movie , 
The funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen 
An air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters 
It will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking . 
At the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
Comes off as a pale successor 
Reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy 
Something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities 
Left of his passe ' chopsocky glory 
The most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg 's misunderstood career 
Radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film 
To be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being 
Goes awry 
Bibbidy-bobbidi-bland 
Bogs down in insignificance ,

Ca n't even do that much . 
Cobbled together out of older movies 
Real dawns , comic relief 
You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
Feels like very light errol morris 
Unimpressively fussy 
Might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .

Smart and taut 
A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
The better of obnoxious adults 
A vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding 
, their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
Smarter and more diabolical 
This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` why 
Might not have noticed 
Would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways 
Cheesy backdrops , 
It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
The wrong times 
One of the more influential works of the ` korean new wave ' 
In getting under the skin of her characters 
Nasty

And immature provocations 
Is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness 
A chocolate 
Stroked , luridly colored , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain 
Whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone 
Bogs down in genre cliches

Entirely suspenseful , 
Hard , endearing , caring 
The tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
It 's a rare window on an artistic collaboration . 
Murphy and owen wilson 
The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . 
Is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . 
It goes nowhere 
Under our skin 
Decent 
Otherwise excellent 
One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
Muddy 
Slick production values and director roger michell 's tick-tock pacing 
Predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game 
That it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time 
This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy 
Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
A nice little story in the process 
Way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness 
Is a vulgar 
Chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece 
Interesting to see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity 
Some very good acting , dialogue 
It 's a brazenly misguided project 
Primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of 
Anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
Inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth 
Find a place among the studio 's animated classics 
That , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing 
Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and i know this because i 've seen ` jackass : the movie . 
A big corner office in hell 
On every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
Smart new comedy 
Get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy 
's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments 
Too slow for a younger crowd 
As an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable 
A long , unfunny one at that 
Is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love 
Who comes to america speaking not a word of english 
Obviously desired 
Interesting cinematic devices 
An uneasy marriage 
Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet 's `` house of games '' and last fall 's `` heist '' so much fun .

Gripping performances by lane and gere

Mind-bending

Is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
Return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , 
A high water mark for this genre 
A memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill . 
Shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
Far more witty 
Piercingly affecting ... while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying 
The whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece 
As darkly funny , 
Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition 
That made it all work 
( a ) real pleasure in its laid-back way . 
A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions

Ill-advised 
Insane liberties 
Dreadfully earnest inversion 
Created a monster

Will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment . 
Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .

Female friendship that men can embrace and

Wet burlap sack

Would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic . 
What might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .

Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u.s. -- a major director is emerging in world cinema 
Captures the wonders and worries of childhood

Off-putting romantic comedy . 
Frida with a visual style unique and inherent 
Own solemn insights 
Like the best of godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
Too sappy for its own good . 
Smart and dark 
Found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
Generous and subversive 
A mexican soap opera 
The film 's considered approach 
Are odd and pixilated and 
The unsung heroes of 20th century 
, and for the memorable character creations 
A captivating and intimate study about dying and loving 
So i do n't know what she 's doing in here 
Looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara is n't even halfway through 
Not the great american comedy 
Not only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny 
Children 's entertainment , superhero comics 
This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon 
And rough-hewn vanity project 
Normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad 
If it belongs on the big screen 
Comfort food 
Makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
Far more appealing 
It does in trouble every day 
Indie comedy 
A solid , anguished performance 
Suspenseful enough 
What i liked about it 
Every once in a while a film 
The abiding impression 
, then triple x marks the spot . 
After an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock 's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
, seamless and sumptuous stream 
The point of ridiculousness 
Pessimism 
Has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society 
Brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa 's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
Only the odd enjoyably chewy lump 
Situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle 's carpets 
Is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter 
It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise . 
Unsatisfying muddle 
And it 's a lousy one at that . 
The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
, rohmer 's talky films fascinate me 
His slop 
Of devito 's misanthropic vision 
The uncompromising knowledge 
Has nothing 
Of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band 
Sloppiness 
Our reality tv obsession , and even 
Recycled plot 
Smartly written 
No longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
Want nothing else than to show us a good time 
Nolan 's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair 
Pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting 
It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , 
Close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be 
Gives added clout to this doc 
Has little insight into the historical period and its artists , 
Vowing , ` 
Is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , 
Too manipulative 
That the e-graveyard 
The sum of its pretensions 
Virtually no one is bound to show up at theaters for it 
Fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing 
Perverse 
Wilco fans will have a great time 
Has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
A bodice-ripper for intellectuals 
The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; 
Gets vivid performances from her cast and 
Set out to lampoon , anyway . 
Emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable 
Hypermasculine 
Right-thinking ' films 
Real bump-in - the-night chills 
Childish things 
Used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd 
Film school brat 
Immaculately 
Guilt-suffused melodrama 
Is spooky and subtly in love with myth 
Self-hatred and 
From which no interesting concept can escape 
It 's not like having a real film of nijinsky 
Sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches 
Turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . 
With witty dialogue and inventive moments 
Amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise 
An oddly winning portrayal 
Do n't make movies like they used to anymore 
Satisfying summer 
A superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing . 
Of its heightened , well-shaped dramas 
A battle between bug-eye theater and dead-eye 
Like a good guy 
Constrictive 
Tender and heart-wrenching 
Watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours 
The unacceptable , 
This gorgeous epic 
Does n't quite know how to fill a frame . 
Re-voiced version 
Elite 
In that are generally not heard on television 
Is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
Is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor . 
Is a goofy pleasure 
Remains mostly undeterminable 
Bizarre 
Should serve detention 
Is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
Strong narrative 
Is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . ' 
Put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
Becomes a testament to faith . 
Hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
Can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
Burns out 
It does have one saving grace . 
( hayek ) throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
Satisfyingly scarifying 
, enveloping affection 
Thoughtless , 
Remarkably cohesive 
Comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt 
A thriller without a lot of thrills . 
Middle east 
The week blown up for the big screen 
Is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries 
Of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either 
Appreciation 
The mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
Any way of gripping what its point is , or 
Slap her 
Seeking to pull a cohesive story out 
Ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up 
Fast-moving 
Wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender 
Offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
By and large this is mr. kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since the doors 
A florid turn 
Impressive stagings 
Immensely appealing couple 
Manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them 
Delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story 
But fails to keep it up and settles into clich��s . 
Little visible talent and 
As three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year 
Interesting and 
So much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess 
Iosseliani 
Mysterious and brutal nature 
Going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous 
It may not be particularly innovative , 
An adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground 
Too ludicrous and 
Against governmental odds 
Odd and weird . 
Adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
Was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash 
Her cheery and tranquil suburban life 
The things that made the original men in black such a pleasure 
Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
At a bad rock concert 
's like an all-star salute 
Muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch 
The kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
Paints a grand picture of an era 
An intelligent , realistic portrayal 
Ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters 
's all quite tasteful to look at 
With some powerful people 
Is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis bu?uel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
Funniest film 
Of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and 
A chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note 
Remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end 
French shocker 
It 's simply unbearable 
Filmmakers and performers of this calibre 
The jokes , 
Pretty decent 
Has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . 
Sterile 
Gives a human face to what 's often discussed in purely abstract terms 
Phlegmatic bore 
, bad movie 
Refresh our souls 
Unimpeachable clarity

A visionary marvel , 
Is a lot more bluster than bite 
As a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil ' bow wow 
The compelling historical tale 
This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) 
Delicate , clever direction 
Rock-solid little genre picture 
A sturdiness and solidity 
Plateau 
Is attractive . 
It falls far short of poetry , 
Sharp and quick documentary 
Robert harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills 
Is silly but strangely believable . 
It falls short 
; not the craven of ' a nightmare on elm street ' or ` the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` deadly friend 
Found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
Fast-paced and 
Too silly to take seriously . 
I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
Not without cheesy fun factor . 
Enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd 
Rewarding . 
Secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting 
Able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man 
Cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set 
With an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable `` formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but

Some remarkable achival film 
For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .

Rude 
Stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
Annoying and artificial 
First-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
An immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music .

Alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary 
Simply put , `` far from heaven '' is a masterpiece .

That plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters

What the movie lacks in action 
With the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing 
Another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective 
, the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , 
To feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
Gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy 
Like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it . 
Dramaturgy 
Odd and 
Play out realistically if not always fairly 
A masterpiece -- and a challenging one 
Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .

Small delights

Hopes and dreams 
Made watchable by a bravura performance 
Exactly what its title implies : lusty , boisterous and utterly charming . 
Is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable 
To have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .

A rather unique approach 
It 's tremendously moving 
Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
Is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .

Completely awful iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .

A sense of action 
Has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock 's imaginative flight to shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff . 
They fascinate in their recklessness . 
's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title 
It interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul 's perspective 
Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
Often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers 
Her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style 
Keep it from being a total rehash 
Uneven but a lot of fun 
Hitting your head on the theater seat 
An example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience 
Hypocritical work 
Lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor 
Laden with plenty of baggage 
With complicated plotting and banal dialogue 
Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
Uninspired 
Just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work 
A pleasant piece 
An excellent cast 
It 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism 
Episode 
Have an original bone in his body 
Is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces 
Feel absolutely earned 
Slippery slope 
Gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , 
All of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely . 
By turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
Sickly 
Impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
Probably want to see it twice 
By his lack of self-awareness 
The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on b��ttner -- 
, it 's also cold , gray , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated . 
That expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
's bright 
, the emotions seem authentic 
Close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
, ' it also rocks . 
Life-changing chance encounters 
Female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor 
Is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- 
Audacious-impossible 
The visual panache 
In practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life 
A more measured or polished production ever could 
Appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans 
A stylish thriller . 
The movie is a trove of delights . 
Constructs 
Nicks sustains the level of exaggerated , stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit . 
This is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humor and pathos . 
Chris 
It may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all 
When commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
It might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home 
A sly female empowerment movie , 
Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , i ca n't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears 
Hits the bullseye 
With formalist experimentation in cinematic art 
's a very sincere work 
Searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... 
A dualistic battle between good and evil 
Unembarrassing but unmemorable 
Are becoming irritating 
Expects something special but instead gets ( sci-fi ) rehash 
Comes together as a coherent whole . 
Improvement 
Languishing 
Even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there 's something vital about the movie . 
Leblanc thought , `` hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . '' 
Forget that they are actually movie folk

Has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women 
Struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
The clich��-riddled genre 
Certified 
Straightforward and old-fashioned 
` innovative ' and ` realistic ' 
Really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
Creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees 
Features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
Is attractive 
Is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle 
Amusements 
Director rick famuyiwa 's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema 
Seem goofy rather than provocative 
The strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure 
Something i would rather live in denial about 
It ca n't really be called animation 
Motivated by something more than franchise possibilities 
With the lovely hush 
Roussillon providing comic relief 
The film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
Of the clients 
The eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
Own fear and paranoia 
Elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na?f 's encounter with the world .

Flawless amounts

Romantic thriller

Wonderfully creepy mood 
The film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture

What 's best about

There 's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing . 
In the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
Surprisingly powerful and universal . 
, it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
Who are alternately touching and funny 
Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and 
Spirals downward 
You 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
Loves both dance and cinema 
I enjoyed barbershop 
They do n't fit well together and neither is well told . 
Silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
Shines like a lonely beacon . 
Satisfy the boom-bam crowd 
Pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys 
The young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams 
One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved . 
For an unfocused screenplay 
Chaotic 
Me no lika da accents so good , 
An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
Smeary and blurry 
Serious 
Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
Care too much about this love story 
Pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society

Who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair 
Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing . 
So in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
Feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film

It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time .

So many red herrings 
Kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book

Not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me 
Almost saccharine domestic interludes 
A leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
Me want to pack raw dough in my ears 
This nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
By uneven dialogue and plot lapses 
The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .

As well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , 
Truth 
's not only dull because we 've seen ( eddie ) murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed 
That pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy

To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and i wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough . 
Perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty 
Fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere 
Sets out to entertain and 
Wonderful thing 
You wish had been developed with more care 
Down on their working-class subjects 
Stale gags 
Cold , pretentious , 
To this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism 
One of the best films 
Much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay 
The threat implied in the title pok��mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
To keep our interest 
Undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references 
The screen in frustration 
Is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
Is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted . 
Belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
Demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop 
Invited to the party 
Only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny 
Stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
For illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters 
Drag on 
This is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 
Worked wonders 
I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
The holes in this film remain agape -- 
If you 're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix 
However , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
If you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging 
More frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds 
Remarkably accessible and haunting 
Too much kid-vid 
Fessenden continues to do interesting work , 
I was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
Ultimately unpredictable 
Enjoyed 
Unemployment 
More than she can handle 
A spontaneity 
Be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption 
Moving and not infrequently breathtaking 
It 's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
A work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
Cautions 
With imbecilic mafia 
Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable . 
Will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor 
's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started 
Ivan is a prince of a fellow 
Has virtually nothing to show 
It looks good , 
Of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding 
The recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart 
Makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here 
Assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him 
Oddly humorous 
Heady , biting , be-bop 
Funny in a sick , twisted sort of way . 
Might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts 
Sharp as a samurai sword 
It 's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . 
Hits a nerve 
It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense 
Transcends 
Than most third-rate horror sequels 
Does n't work . 
In a collectively stellar performance 
Silly rather than 
Seen some bad singer-turned actors 
A definitive counter-cultural document 
Paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , 
A fragile framework 
Plotting and mindless action 
A road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song 
Is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . 
You 're an agnostic carnivore 
To recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal 
Able to tear their eyes away from the screen 
Fare with real thematic heft 
New york 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief 
Full of stunning images and effects 
Savvy director robert j. siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
Bad love 
But as you watch the movie , you 're too interested to care . 
Cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most . 
This is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that 's as entertaining as it is instructive . 
The story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr. day-lewis roars with leonine power 
Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... 
Made me want to scream 
Dicaprio 's best performance 
For the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
Neither original 
About the worst thing 
Out-bad-act the other 
Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination 
Cinematic touchstone 
Fairly weak retooling 
Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
Is n't that funny 
It 's a loathsome movie , 
Thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes 
This film : honest 
A haunting ode to humanity 
Lowly studio hack 
The irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time 
Pallid 
Authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study 
Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george 's haplessness and lucy 's personality tics . 
Is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
Slaloming through its hackneyed elements 
The english call ` too clever by half 
Certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
Read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame 
Ambiguous enough to be engaging and 
Outstanding 
Humor , verve and fun 
... a guiltless film for nice evening out . 
We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
The comic touch 
It won -- and wins still 
, you 'd better have a good alternative 
Climactic setpiece 
Has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control 
As it is instructive 
Argento 
, secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
Of inept filmmaking 
Is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
Exploitative for the art houses and 
Just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving 
Labute continues to improve . 
All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
Pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon 
The most poorly staged and lit action 
All round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
High-strung 
Effective in all its aspects 
Can not help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director 's cut . ' 
Is an inspirational love story , 
Frustrating misfire 
's a good yarn-spinner 
The great films about movie love 
, unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke . 
Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
The job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez 
Exploitation 
Upon layer of action man clich�� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( woo 's ) best work 
Reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one 
Ready to go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike 
Designed to fill time , 
Conventional thriller 
The disappointingly generic nature 
An important movie 
To make enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' 
, awe-inspiring visual poetry 
Self-centered 
Soulful nuances 
Its recycled aspects , implausibility , 
The one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and 
Starting 
Riveting and surprisingly romantic ride 
The right choices 
's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory 
An incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
Unforced , rapid-fire delivery 
A rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool 
Every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage 
Particularly joyless 
Alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise . 
The funnier movies 
Wooden performances 
Self-promotion ends and 
Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
The screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` dungeons and dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry ... 
Has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , 
Demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
Most enchanting film 
( siegel ) and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
Agile 
Cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma 
The movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode 
Seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation 
From each film 
Soulful , scathing and 
, avarice and damaged dreams 
An abyss 
Wisdom and humor 
Well worth revisiting as many times 
, he has at least one more story to tell : his own . 
We did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show 
Adds enough quirky and satirical touches 
Have viewers guessing just who 's being conned right up to the finale 
The best little `` horror '' movie 
It 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space 
This ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel 
Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie . 
, secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
Of scorn 
The finest kind 
A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours . 
, it has a genuine dramatic impact 
The cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot 
The art direction is often exquisite 
Fun and nimble . 
Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
's all about anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect 
Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion 
Yes , soar . 
An alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary . 
Is a few bits funnier than malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks 
Odd movies 
Can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin ' down . 
Reach a truly annoying pitch 
O matter how much good will the actors generate 
Offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment 
The outstanding thrillers of recent years 
Dumb down 
Generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series 
Barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
Graphic violence 
We really have n't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's reign of fire 
Is smart and entirely charming 
Is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
A hilarious kenneth branagh 
Tender and 
Spirited film 
's a dark , gritty story 
The slippery slope of dishonesty 
An adorably whimsical comedy 
It might have been 
Addictive 
Swings and jostles 
What time offers tsai 's usual style and themes 
Pleasing 
So uninspiring 
Touching and 
Genial romance 
Onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless 
Charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . 
Even at its worst , it 's not half-bad . 
It looks good , sonny , 
Make a huge action sequence as any director 
Time bombs and 
The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
Promising work-in-progress 
Folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either 
To have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept 
Does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds 
A pale successor 
Elegantly appointed period drama 
Captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it 
Is as difficult for the audience to take as it 
My big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as ' a perfect family film , ' because it 's about family . 
Has really found his groove these days . 
Impressive and highly entertaining celebration 
Helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
Interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side 
Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
Cliche 
I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but 
Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through 
Has far more energy 
On dave barry 's popular book of the same name 
A heartfelt romance 
Devoid of joy and energy 
A rehash of every gangster movie 
To the edge of their seats 
Is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
Of longing , lasting traces of charlotte 's web of desire and desperation 
Sealed in a jar 
This might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their *** off for an hour-and-a-half 
To tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents 
That rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness 
To great performances 
Charged music to the ears of cho 's fans . 
As a numbingly dull experience 
Left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
Offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
Admirable energy , 
Milquetoast 
A tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing 
Seem heroic deserves a look . 
Proves a servicable world war ii drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances 
Hit 
Terrific 10th-grade learning tool 
Sobering , heart-felt drama 
Enjoyed . 
's a sheer unbridled delight in the way 
What could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking . 
Its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and 
Prove more distressing 
Stuffy , full of itself 
Flourishes 
Like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
Mr. clooney , mr. kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster . 
Could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage 
Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in 
Spreads itself too thin 
Redundancy 
Good actors , even kingsley , 
Uninhibited 
Is n't much better . 
And flat-out farce 
To a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
Yet another genre exercise , gangster no. 1 is as generic as its title . 
A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
Good-natured and 
A simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent 
A kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another 
Happiness 
's contrived and predictable 
The sexual politics too smug 
A movie is more than a movie . 
Is slightly less successful than the first 
Sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 
A film of epic scale 
With an enormous amount of affection 
Explosive 
Is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
Leaves no southern stereotype unturned 
That works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times 
Kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies 
Communal spirit 
's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough 
One-of-a-kind 
A lot like a well-made pb & j sandwich : 
Consigned to the dustbin of history 
Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` serving sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff 
Richly detailed , 
, as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable 
Is so convinced of its own brilliance 
To bring something new into the mix 
Drop your jaw 
Of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery 
Allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject . 
Becomes a testament to faith 
An idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt 
Hopeless , unsatisfying muddle 
So it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast 
's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
With their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact 
For their acting chops , but for their looks 
Visual and verbal clich��s 
Gore 
Is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films 
It provides a fresh view of an old type 
Romance-novel 
Bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy 
Possible angle 
Nothing too deep or substantial . 
Invented to describe exactly how bad it is 
Were far more entertaining than i had expected 
To appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
Near virtuosity in its crapulence 
At blockbuster 
Contemporary 
So slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it 
Lost the politics and the social observation 
Comedic 
Might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . 
A spectacular completion one 
Screams 
At least a few good ideas and 
Villainous 
Creepy and dead-on performance 
( there 's ) quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
The debate it joins is a necessary and timely one 
I know i should n't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old 
A fullness 
Too painfully 
Best sex comedy 
Crassly 
's a dull girl , that 's all 
Repeating 
Barlow 
King lear 
That stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours 
Coolness 
Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly 
To work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon 
Still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned . 
Impacts 
Takes no apparent joy in making movies 
, generosity and diplomacy 
Fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films 
Been filmed more irresistibly than in ` baran 
Once again dazzle and delight us 
Enchanting 
Will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle 
Should drop everything and run to ichi . 
Is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler 
Grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery 
Unsettling prognosis 
It 's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
Usual whoopee-cushion effort 
A collage of clich��s and a dim 
Nauseating 
Hunk 
More entertaining 
Reality shows -- reality shows for god 's sake ! 
Stirring , funny 
Is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender 
, perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
Suffered 
That a good video game movie is going to show up soon 
Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place 
Their largest-ever historical canvas 
Video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
Romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters 
Feel a nagging sense of deja vu 
So interesting 
This misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
Feel-good 
Robert harmon 's less-is-more approach 
Truly deserving of its oscar nomination 
Most resonant film since the killer 
, scotland , pa would be forgettable if it were n't such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play . 
Is that rare animal known as ' a perfect family film , ' because it 's about family 
Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
By characters so unsympathetic 
Cold , 
Winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
, relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . 
, i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
Thumbs up 
Uplifting 
, but with restraint 
Girls , right down the reality drain 
( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) 
Bloody beauty 
A confusing melange of tones and styles , 
What annoyed me most about god is great 
A movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . 
Pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious 
Charming , quirky , original 
The great minds 
A fascinating part 
Something clever 
Most appealing movies 
One of the best movies of the year 
Joys 
( cool visual backmasking ) 
Towards child abuse 
Much about the film , including some of its casting 
Milked 
Lovely and 
Sharp comedy , 
Have easily tipped this film into the `` a '' range , as is 
Pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
Sign 
Getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing 
Is a success 
Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and 
Movie audiences both innocent and jaded 
Has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
As the voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie 
Exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute 
Done the nearly impossible 
Is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . ' 
Brittle desperation 
The entire point of a shaggy dog story 
Represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken . 
But it works under the direction of kevin reynolds 
To be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain 
Does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
Chance to prove his worth 
To drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine 
That between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , 
Seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation 
Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here 
Great movie 
A little better than sorcerer 's stone 
A heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist 
Is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
Worked five years ago 
Shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians 
To win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , 
If the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks 
A romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny 
Populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
Major movie 
A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 
The ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm 
The screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
Lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit 
Marvelously twisted shapes history 
Following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish 
Have no affinity for most of the characters . 
, unfunny one 
Animated filmmaking since old walt 
The movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation . 
In how much they engage and even touch us 
Of death 
Full-bodied performance 
Holds interest 
What an embarrassment . 
Inventive and mordantly humorous 
To be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god 's sake ! 
A fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare 's plays . 
Like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie does n't offer much more than the series , but 
, even the funniest idea is n't funny . 
Is muted 
The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable 
A spectator 
Skillful fisher 
Is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power . 
Unlike lots of hollywood fluff 
The mark 
Unfortunately 
The film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- 
Carried by a strong sense of humanism 
Dull-witted 
A retail clerk 
Potentially trite and overused 
Predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor 
It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but 
Capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke 
Recycled 
Who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers 
Exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace 
, his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
A rather unbelievable love interest 
Longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville 's stomach 
Writings to perform 
Starts out strongly 
A film school undergrad 
Worked so much better dealing in only one reality 
Has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements . 
Left the theater 
Weaving a theme 
More satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action 
Pitch-perfect forster 
Joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to 
Status 
Fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines 
For the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love 
, memory , resistance and artistic transcendence 
The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions 
Disoriented 
The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and 
Tawdry 
Need another film that praises female self-sacrifice 
Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
Top-notch 
Is beyond me . 
All the interesting developments 
Your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
Austin powers in goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
Assured of the wrong things 
Resemble their celebrity parents 
Sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading 
Is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , 
Laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , 
A bad way 
Foster and whitaker are especially fine . 
Dreary and sluggish 
Re-creation 
That uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence 
In other words , it 's just another sports drama/character study . 
Bask in your own cleverness 
Wastes the talents of its attractive young leads 
The low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
Like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story 
It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
A hunky has-been 
Complete denial about his obsessive behavior 
A movie of riveting power and sadness 
Clever and 
That may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless 
... built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
Going through the motions 
A more down-home flavor 
Feels familiar and tired . 
Versatile stanley kwan 
Are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . 
Ai n't art , by a long shot 
Fingering problems than finding solutions 
Can not even be dubbed hedonistic 
Fine star performances 
A scummy ripoff 
World traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , 
Leaving the theater 
An odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime 
It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
They will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas 
It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
( grant ) goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
Punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . ' 
Despite downplaying her good looks 
An astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent 's smirk . 
Promises a new kind of high 
Has a laundry list of minor shortcomings 
Sensational , real-life 19th-century crime 
Puzzle whose pieces do not fit . 
More streamlined 
He seems embarrassed to be part of 
Much panache , but with material this rich it does n't need it 
Works spectacularly well ... a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
Courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis 
An enjoyable choice 
( dong ) makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and 
Injects freshness and spirit 
Filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power 
Surrealist 
Morality , family 
Yet engrossing piece 
Things will turn out 
So good 
Not one clever line of dialogue 
That contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what 
Drug abuse 
Exploitative garbage 
Handbag-clutching 
Greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
Cocktail 
An in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends 
Does n't give you enough to feel good about 
Is a wonderful thing 
-- and far less crass - 
The perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel 
The clumsy clich�� 
Tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down 
Exceeding expectations 
So integrated with the story 
The work of an artist 
To feel like you were n't invited to the party 
Limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action 
Diane lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue adrian lyne 's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
Too often strains 
Dogs who are smarter than him 
Although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
For intelligibility 
With jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour 
's still quite worth 
, joyous celebration 
Has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience 
Somewhat problematic 
A sweet , even delectable diversion 
Too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
Beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
You get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , 
Pays earnest homage to turntablists and 
The transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
Kiddie-oriented stinker 
Potentially incredibly 
Ultimately worthwhile 
Bolster director and co-writer 
With grace and humor 
Directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable ... 
Intrepid 
A convolution of language that suggests it 
Fang-baring lullaby 
Omits 
Interplay and utter lack 
Has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made 
Shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative 
A saga 
Is funny . 
Appropriate comic buttons 
A lovely , sad dance 
Only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
Whenever you think you 've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop . 
Enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens 
A middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor 
As disney 's 1937 breakthrough 
, the humor dwindles . 
Pleasure or 
, well-made b movie 
Such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence . 
Ambitiously naturalistic 
Lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
Falls flat as a spoof 
Already relayed by superb 
Generous and deep 
's a sit down and ponder affair 
If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . 
Fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment 
A subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking 
Our most flamboyant female comics 
Passionate and truthful 
The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
Added clout to this doc 
Exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small 
Far more meaningful story 
Not only to his craft , but to his legend 
Keep the film entertaining 
The histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
To hell 
This filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it 's filmed tosca that you want . 
's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn 
Seriously intended movie 
They 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
A mediocre exercise 
Were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes 
Charm and heart 
Of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating 
A sickening thud 
For its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting 
Inspirational 
It amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film 
Irksome , tiresome nature 
Miraculous as its dreamworks makers 
Wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits 
Brian tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
` best part ' of the movie 
Judith and zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 
Pretends to be passionate and truthful 
Is too optimistic a title . 
Create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
By its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past 
Will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it 
A welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
Hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs 
Full of grace 
A dearth 
Is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit 
Yeah , baby 
, amusing , sad and reflective 
Enjoyable ... 
Comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives 
Laughably 
At least terribly monotonous 
Able to look ahead and resist living in a past 
Contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
Lackluster script 
Might to resist 
Could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors 
Which is nothing to sneeze at these days 
Which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy 
Alienating most 
Perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment 
Cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama 
Neither is well told 
Natural and lovely 
Is superficial and 
This woefully hackneyed movie , 
Dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film 
Through the audience 's meat grinder one more 
One of the funnier movies in town . 
Brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
Compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy 
Olympia , wash. , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting 
A twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller 
's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
Of the war 
Ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints 
In the conception than it does in the execution 
Has nothing 
Is amused by its special effects 
Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds . 
Such a bad movie 
I shamelessly enjoyed it 
Or maybe `` how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? '' 
Corny examination 
The wit 
Even life on an aircraft carrier -- 
Too hard to be mythic 
A self-indulgent script 
Having a real writer plot 
Afghan tragedies 
Dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... 
To the dullest irish pub scenes 
Goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises 
What makes this film special is serry 's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
Truly funny bits 
Pseudo-philosophic twaddle 
Hard-to-swallow premise 
Hallmark commercial 
Despair 
Ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick 
This wo n't seem like such a bore 
We 've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world 's greatest teacher . 
Straightforward , emotionally honest manner 
Truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne 
Develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
At its best , which occurs often 
Threadbare standbys 
Literate material 
Eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
Director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
Despite its floating narrative 
's no good answer to that one . 
Has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films . 
In eye-popping visuals 
All-time great apocalypse movies 
More than adequately fills the eyes and 
Salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life 
Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
Than i 'd expected it to be 
Well worth revisiting 
A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past 
Remarkable procession 
Loses all bite on the big screen . 
Our emotions 
It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
Take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
The world 's political situation seems little different , and ( director phillip ) noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill 
An insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors 
A compelling film . 
Makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty 
's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life 
A stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino 's climactic shootout -- 
It would n't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
As one of the great submarine stories 
Lagaan 
Provide its thrills and extreme emotions 
Marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending 
Seems hopelessly juvenile 
Appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race 
Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany 
Attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
A movie full of surprises 
Bolstered by exceptional performances and 
` butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
A heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film 
Turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable 
Entertaining tricks 
More than competent 
Frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably 
The miniseries 
At once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and 
Turn and devolves 
Have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema 
The power of the huston performance 
Super troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
Done his subject justice 
Are undeniably touched

Dirty 
Good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , 
Dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care 
Transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision 
Its story is only surface deep 
Is listless , witless , and devoid of anything 
An incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
Movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery 
One funny popcorn flick . 
Although ... visually striking and slickly staged 
, masterful 
Wonderfully warm human drama 
Bigger and more ambitious than the first installment 
Now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it 
Worst movie 
It made me feel unclean , and i 'm the guy who liked there 's something about mary and both american pie movies 
Great minds 
A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
Ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive 
Scotland looks wonderful , 
Disposable , kitchen-sink homage 
Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but 
Expiration date 
Powerful look 
Such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema 
A couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay 
Catching for griffiths ' warm and winning central performance

It was n't horrible either 
A fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna 
You have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky 
The delicate forcefulness of greene 's prose 
It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
, it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
In the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug 
Something of a stiff 
, retro uplifter . 
What 's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behavior . 
Ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
The otherwise good-naturedness of mr. deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely new york celebrities 
Uses a totally unnecessary prologue , 
Also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting .

Have pulled off four similar kidnappings before 
Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock ( since sept. 11 ) . 
Is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe 
Fortunately , elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry . 
Last-minute 
Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
So aggressively anti-erotic 
Have a hard time sitting through this one 
Reminiscent 
Suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
Deception 
Feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago 
Has severe body odor 
Capture these musicians in full regalia

Make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season 
Dover kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut 
Delightful , if minor , 
No level whatsoever for me 
To create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
Is this bad on purpose 
, that 's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat . 
Is an interesting movie ! '' 
Offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse 
Pertinent and enduring 
's stylishly directed with verve ... 
Its shortness disappoints 
Deeply meditative picture 
Until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
This prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy 
Compassionate spirit 
Great dragons ! 
I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short 
A memorable experience 
Serves up with style and empathy 
Keep our interest 
Gooding is the energetic frontman , and it 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences 
Absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters 
( the characters ' ) misery 
Hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic ... love moore or loathe him , you 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions 
Effectiveness 
The one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
An intriguing twist 
Succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n't be dismissed as mindless 
Rejects 
Infidelity and 
A genuinely funny ensemble 
Got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out 
Fabulously funny 
Might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine 
Seems worth the effort . 
Terrific date movie 
Not a trace of humanity or empathy 
Fourth feature 
Reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
A milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen 
Predictable plot 
The visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
Does strong , measured work 
More and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent 
It is n't that funny 
Slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze 
Sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack 
Squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story 
An engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who 's being conned right up to the finale . 
Crowd-pleasing goals 
Tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film

A baffling subplot

Tasteful 
On its empty head 
To pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie 
Recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders 
's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid 
Numbingly dull experience 
The chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
Never comes together as a coherent whole . 
I think it was plato who said , ' i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theater for this one 
Cute drama 
, taut , piercing and feisty 
Cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . 
The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na?vet�� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
Unturned 
Far more successful 
A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
Has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera 's drama and lyricism 
Being able to creep the living hell out of you 
Ourside the theater roger might be intolerable company , 
It revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
Deeply biased , and wholly 
Failing , ultimately , 
This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
Without having much dramatic impact 
Into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell 
The histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch 
Of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati 
Uplifting and moving 
Already tired 
Manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
Marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . 
Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames 
The scruffy sands of its titular community 
As searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful 
To make creative contributions to the story and dialogue 
A delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving 
It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy 
The film has some of the best special effects ever 
See this turd squashed 
( a ) soulless , stupid sequel 
It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . 
What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` panic room '' 
Creatively

The actors are simply too good 
Is one only a true believer could relish . 
Signals director rick famuyiwa 's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema

It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so 
Crappy movies 
Make a big splash 
An equally assured narrative coinage 
A beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep ` epic . ' 
Recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from lonely boy to do n't look back . 
Of clich��s and a dim 
Gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements 
Underestimated 
Is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast 
Does n't have big screen magic 
... pitiful , slapdash disaster . 
The woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , 
A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
Unbearable 
To be moved by this drama 
A clich��d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying 
Manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish 
Distracting 
From the guy-in-a-dress genre 
The consequences of its own actions and revelations 
It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
This trite , predictable rehash 
Uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd 
Benefited from a sharper , cleaner script 
There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) 
Just as endearing and easy 
Into by-the-numbers territory 
I feel better already . 
Never quite 
, i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . 
Of the rarest kinds of films 
This masterful 
Is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
Overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors 
Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity 
's too long and unfocused 
Like-themed film 
Exceedingly dull 
The mood is laid back 
The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
Debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined 
Helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome 
Sneak out of the theater 
Unsalvageability 
A successful adaptation 
Ambiguous 
Is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
You barely realize your mind is being blown . 
True 
Adrenalized 
Hollywood excess 
Would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
A servicable world war ii drama 
Zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups

Should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame 
A clever pseudo-bio 
First-rate 
Low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off 
Since the empire strikes back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth 
Sentimentality and annoying stereotypes

A movie without an apparent audience 
Keep things interesting 
The stomach-knotting suspense 
First film something of a sleeper success 
The best movie 
Returning director rob minkoff ... and screenwriter bruce joel rubin ... have done a fine job of updating white 's dry wit to a new age . 
Beat-the-clock thriller 
Collision 
An intelligent and deeply 
Pleasant distraction 
To come from an american director in years 
Thoroughly entertaining comedy that 
To the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , 
Dramatic enough 
Change hackneyed concepts 
Credulous , unassuming , subordinate 
Dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags 
A bold ( and lovely ) experiment 
Undeniably exceedingly clever 
Taymor , the avant garde director of broadway 's the lion king and the film titus , brings 
Terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting 
Frittered 
To mind , while watching eric rohmer 's tribute to a courageous scottish lady 
Its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes 
Is even better than the fellowship . 
Could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
Deceptively simple , deeply satisfying 
Such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images 
Utterly delightful . 
Reaches 
Imperfect 
Ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside 
Like kubrick , soderbergh is n't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
Will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story 
A beer with but they 're simply not funny performers 
It would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde 's classic satire . 
` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women 
The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
Every-joke-has - been-told-a 
Carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades 
Amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario 
It the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel 
Induce sleep than fright 
The film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
Funniest moments 
An equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress 
Glee 
The quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
Protagonists 
With terrific flair 
Does n't have much panache , but with material this rich it does n't need it . 
By an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos 
Shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action 
Know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics 
's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
Blandly go where we went 8 movies ago 
Painfully slow cliche-ridden film 
The writing is indifferent , 
Of its own brilliance 
Ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
Misanthropic stuff 
One eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material 
The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them 
Quite touching 
Keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions 
With this one too 
Surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
Developed characters so much 
, populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine 
's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich��s . 
A defiantly retro chord 
Efficiently 
The emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , 
Faced 
First-time director jo?o pedro rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations 
In his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters 
The film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half 
Its bold presentation 
The wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
Makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
Vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world 
There is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
Hard-edged stuff

Terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid 
Underdeveloped effort 
It 's an ambitious film ,

A slick , 
To the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script

Meandering ending 
Schlocky 
Realistic , non-exploitive approach 
Overcooked

A witty , whimsical feature 
Stands as one of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences 
Skewed to ever get a hold on 
As it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen 
An act of spiritual faith 
Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations 
's not even a tv special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break 
Perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey 
Is good , except its timing 
An uninspired philosophical epiphany 
Spiced 
Listless and desultory affair 
If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .

Rusted-out ruin 
Fine acting moments 
Are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) 
A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
Those crass , contrived sequels

That this is one summer film that satisfies 
Forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today 
Creepy-scary thriller 
Dangerously honest 
This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it 
The plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion 
An intense political and psychological thriller 
Thoroughly dull 
A fine production with splendid singing

Gone badly awry

Nothing wrong with performances here , 
It would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .

Quite a vision 
Cause parents a few sleepless hours -- 
Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode 
Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long 
An attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place

Lightly entertaining

Imaginative flight

With a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half 
Little-remembered 
Blame eddie murphy 
Less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and 
Out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clich��s . 
Persistence that is sure to win viewers ' hearts 
The schmaltz is manufactured 
Used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again 
See over and over again 
It 's worth yet another visit 
A great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
A coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece

Waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense 
That everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in 
84 minutes is short 
Of privileged moments and memorable performances

Photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces 
That relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations 
Feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
Horrid little propaganda film 
I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater 
He does this so well 
As two-day old porridge

Seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense 
It 's in danger of going wrong 
Out ballsy and stylish 
Manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .

That ` alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) 
Frothy ` date movie 
Are both excellent , 
Described as sci-fi generic 
Confusion is one of my least favorite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
What remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes . 
Escaped the rut dug by the last one

Smoothly sinister freddie

Hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull 
A light , yet engrossing piece 
A disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv 's big brother .

It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
Devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry 
Cultural identity 
Avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake 
Full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature 
Transparently hypocritical work 
Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
Struggles

Smell the grease on the plot 
There 's a lot to recommend read my lips .

Quirky and fearless ability 
Puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting 
Wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and 
Should not 
A remarkable piece 
Like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens 
Its own ironic implications

Graceless and

Attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight 
Need , neurosis and nervy

Of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics 
Rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
Imperfect , love-hate relationship 
The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
The annoyance

You have the patience for it 
It were any more of a turkey 
The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time 
A shaky , uncertain film

Playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .

An interesting exercise 
The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
Writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
's the sweet cinderella story 
The passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times 
As darkly funny 
A disaster of a drama 
The first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time

Does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
Sour 
Like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks 
All the bad things in the world / 
This is the most visually unappealing . 
As good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand 
Delirious fun . 
Lisa rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
Is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one 
Look like cheap hysterics 
's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling 
To see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity 
Reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles 
That malarkey

Incredibly hokey 
Fluffy and disposible 
Fascinating little tale 
It 's never too late to believe in your dreams . ' 
I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
So many explosions 
The scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian . 
Nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
Seems timely and important . 
, soap opera-ish dialogue 
Close to losing my lunch 
Settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs 
Director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , 
A lot of the smaller scenes 
Chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
With a great premise 
Appalling as any ` comedy ' 
An elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice 
Love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
Hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as 
's icky . 
Wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt 
Made me feel unclean 
Like saturday morning tv in the '60s 
Astonishing grandeur 
Fully endear itself to american art house audiences 
Is a step down 
Does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes 
Be this good 
The film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr. broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover . 
Heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations 
Two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
Antic spirits 
Mark ms. bullock 's best work 
Of slapstick sequences 
Imaginable 
Is a hilarious adventure 
More trifle than triumph .

A mediocre tribute to films like them 
Unmemorable filler 
Well-made entertainment 
What little grace ( rifkin 's ) tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves 
Which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way 
Ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr. de niro . 
Is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort 
That accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough 
But the project surrounding them is distressingly rote 
Oozes craft . 
Does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds 
Where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say 
Succeeds . 
That offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone 
Well-done supernatural thriller 
The ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
Is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
Vulgar dialogue 
Sweet time building 
Of the best gay love stories 
A dirty old man 
It never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
No special effects , and 
The real thing 
Female friendship that men can embrace 
Of emotional desperation 
Watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . 
Makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , 
A thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant 's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
Threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
Silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
Shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans 
Several cliched movie structures : the road movie , 
Faster , livelier and 
, funny , and even touching 
Is well 
Its own style 
Of nijinsky 
Interesting controversy 
Incinerates frank capra 's classic 
Reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , 
Sweet and fluffy 
) are such a companionable couple 
How good 
Dull , brain-deadening hangover 
Little sticky and unsatisfied 
Charisma and 
Also a -- dare i say it twice -- 
Blushing to gushing -- imamura squirts the screen in ` warm water under a red bridge ' 
Eccentrics 
's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
Anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering . 
Leaves scant place for the viewer 
Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
Of the victorious revolutionaries 
A positive ( if tragic ) note 
Intelligence and originality 
Also somewhat touched 
Its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
Cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements 
Opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche 
Much worse than bland 
Took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
Overcomes the script 's flaws and envelops the audience in his character 's anguish , anger and frustration 
Assured and stylish 
A ragbag of cliches . 
Of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with 
As though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking 
The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
Rubbish 
Even though the film does n't manage to hit all of its marks , it 's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
A breathtaking adventure 
The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard 
Wind-in-the-hair exhilarating 
Of true inspiration 
A good movie ye who enter here 
A flat , unconvincing drama 
Are so hilarious 
Great to look at , and funny 
Russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . 
Dread 
May seem disappointing in its generalities 
Extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability 
More offended by his lack of faith in his audience 
To its clever what-if concept 
So crazy ! 
Relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form 
Make like the title and dodge this one 
A heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind 
A speed that is slow to those of us in middle age 
Balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident 
Remarkable and 
Warmth and gentle humor 
Life affirming 
The whiney characters bugged me 
Wilco fans will have a great time , and 
19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick 
Ask for a raise 
A gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , 
Moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture 
A hard time sitting through this one 
Is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film 
Perversity 
Does n't have much to say beyond the news 
A knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth 
Rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na?f 's encounter with the world . 
Frighten and 
Ruin 
Intriguing look 
Is that it avoids the obvious with humor and lightness 
Very handsomely produced 
Do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies 
Films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature 
A documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
Is gratefully received 
's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters 
Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them 
A bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism 
Pays off and 
That the talented cast generally 
You see this film you 'll know too 
Every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat . 
The efforts of a first-rate cast 
Pleasant tale 
Frothy ` date movie ' ... 
Laugh-a-minute 
Deflated 
Nice piece of work . 
Trying to be more complex than your average film

It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score

Yes , i suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i did n't 
Fresh , sometimes funny , 
Visually , ` santa clause 2 ' is wondrously creative . 
It 's not scary in the slightest 
Than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades 
, imaginative kid 's movie 
Have an interest in the characters you see 
Sheerly cinematic appeal 
The cartoonish clich��s and sneering humor 
Is hard to resist 
That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one 
Parents love to have their kids 
Feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema 
Perfect festival film 
, simple-minded and stereotypical 
The filmmakers know how to please the eye 
Offend everyone 
In ( this ) meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot 
Although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , `` orange county '' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
Virtually joyless 
Is fluid and quick 
With a searing lead performance 
It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
Feels contrived 
, holds the screen like a true star . 
In a class with spike lee 's masterful 
Is actually quite entertaining . 
's definitely an improvement on the first blade 
Silly-looking 
A buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we 're all in this together . 
Altogether darker side 
Unrelated 
Is really funny 
Richer and more observant 
Cleverness , wit or 
The director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
Insightful and 
Shockingly bad and 
Eloquent film 
Is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays 
Cartoonish performance 
The redeeming feature of chan 's films 
Takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours 
The violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing 
Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . 
P ) 
The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
Angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence 
Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century 
Attempts to be grandiloquent , but 
Want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again 
Like horrible poetry 
That sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Gives poor dana carvey nothing 
A quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness 
Benefit 
The populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit 
Just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style 
Unique 
In the best irish sense 
Amours 
Is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
It 's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion 's attentions . 
Make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
At a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age 
Intense and effective 
Nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion 
Not enough of interest onscreen 
A weird , arresting little ride 
Dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie 
Ghetto fabulousness 
Be with a large dose of painkillers 
Has a nearly terminal case of the cutes 
They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
Christian parents 
For all its shoot-outs 
Putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love 
Empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun 
Wears its heart 
Strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
Adam sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt 
It points out how inseparable the two are 
Relying on animation or dumb humor 
It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
Being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses 
The writing is clever and 
I simply ca n't recommend it enough . 
Edit 
Should be able to find better entertainment 
The show 's concept 
On the promise of excitement 
Is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
Resorting to camp or parody 
An integrity 
Eye-popping 
In its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel 's closely watched trains and danis tanovic 's no man 's land . 
In this crass , low-wattage endeavor 
Of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen 
Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory 
The very top rank 
Chilly , clinical lab report 
Makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
Picture-perfect beach 
Farcically bawdy fantasy 
With so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
Dramatic interest 
Ballsy and 
The movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was 
A unique , well-crafted psychological study 
Is fascinating ... 
Spain 's greatest star wattage 
Wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time

Scope and 
Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating 
This cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
Zoom ! 
It 's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned 
Whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes 
Compelling mix 
In a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance 
's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
It is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
Has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
Hong kong master john woo 
Poo 
Rare sequel 
Tepid and 
Well paced and satisfying little drama 
Of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him 
Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
Easy to watch 
More likely 
Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
Precise 
The film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
Hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks 
Probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems 
Thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd 
, he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
With flailing bodily movements 
Spontaneous 
Feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story 
Has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . 
Highlight reel 
A well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature 
Tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , 
Brilliant piece 
The final product is a ghost 
) comes off like a hallmark commercial 
Devastating testimony 
Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
Excellent performances 
A gorgeously strange movie , heaven 
Getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good 
Resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
It is repetitious 
've marveled at disney 's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world 
It 's compelling 
, heart-felt drama 
Purr 
At leading lives of sexy intrigue 
Like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
'd rather watch them on the animal planet 
Could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ? 
An epic four-hour indian musical 
Become comparatively sane and healthy

An overstylized , pur��ed m��lange 
Showtime deserves the hook .

Cranked out on an assembly line

Crack a smile 
Would seem to be surefire casting .

There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
Ignore but a little too smugly superior to like 
Care less

It even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory 
Smart , savvy , compelling 
Hated 
Builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption 
Superficiality 
Skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms. spears 
Bad ideas and awkwardness 
A career-defining revelation 
An inarticulate screenplay 
Cohesive 
Just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer 
Thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another 
Too clumsy 
Better than inconsequential 
Going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap 
So mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
Humbuggery 
, the stories are quietly moving . 
A teenybopper ed wood film , 
Sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill 
Are so generic 
Cultural and economic subtext 
... a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking . 
Pretends to expose the life of male hustlers 
Is strong as always 
Truly larger-than-life character 
Is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was 
It 's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
Dramatize life 's messiness 
Distractions 
Over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage 
Its elegantly colorful look 
Guilty about it

Might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich�� has been unturned 
Classic movie franchise 
Deepa mehta provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world .

A bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic 
Precarious 
Grey zone 
Which gives you an idea just how bad it was 
Ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` chicago '' in 2002 . 
Martin lawrence live ' is so self-pitying 
If it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for 
Too predictable and far too cliched 
Chelsea hotel 
Is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable 
, like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed 
Duvall 's throbbing sincerity 
Making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden 
Misguided project 
A transparently hypocritical work 
Are more compelling than the execution 
Share no chemistry or engaging charisma 
Tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
( toback 's ) fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard ... 
Well-worn situations 
Begging for attention , 
Goes further 
To make us care about zelda 's ultimate fate 
Works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller

Believing in something does matter 
A film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency 
So stunning 
Elaborate and twisted characters 
By an esteemed writer-actor 
One of the finest films of the year

The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ;

Pairing clayburgh and tambor 
One of the great submarine stories 
Is delightful in the central role 
Develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide 
Is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 
By numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc 's , 
All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale 
Watch witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination 
What once was conviction 
A corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way 
Taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock 's imaginative flight 
Takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces 
Little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that 
Wo n't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , 
, then they works spectacularly well ... a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .

Touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , 
Great artistic significance

An impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds 
Is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues

This humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie ,

Misguided acts of affection 
Would quickly change the channel 
How this one escaped the lifetime network i 'll never know .

Is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
Of time , money and celluloid 
Because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin 
Be depressing , 
Is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .

Episode ii -- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight 
The mediterranean sparkles 
Does a good job 
Seems to take an unseemly pleasure in ( the characters ' ) misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it 
For lameness 
Have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere . 
The film knows what 's unique and quirky about canadians

Worthy and devastating 
The same blueprint 
Never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .

Goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability 
What 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
Comic touch 
Has little clue 
Meandering , low on energy , and 
Gives her best 
Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n't encountered since at least pete 's dragon .

For those who like quirky , slightly strange french films 
Hold dear about cinema 
While broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
Have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand 
The viewers will feel they suffer the same fate 
A serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration

A film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
If you 're burnt out on it 's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you 're looking for .

Provocative

As telling a country skunk 
The perfect movie many have made it out to be

Contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion . 
A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding 
Offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment . 
A perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
Long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy 
The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
Intelligence , wit or innovation

Exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit 
Burning 
Its clever concept 
Like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening 
Well-mounted history lesson 
The komediant is a tale worth catching . 
Is what we call the ` wow ' factor . 
May be based on a true and historically significant story 
So muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through 
The plot and a powerfully evocative mood 
The kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans 
To keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats 
Is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth 
The result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
Is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining 
A very tasteful rock and 
Poor remake 
Brought off with considerable wit 
Its weaknesses 
Stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
Non-stop funny feast 
With this silly little puddle of a movie 
's uninteresting . 
A smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop 
Crummy 
Destroy is also a creative urge 
Has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again 
's a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something 
There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , 
's not too fast and not too slow . 
Lucky break is ( cattaneo ) sophomore slump . 
Pilot episode 
Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up 
, eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but 
Already littered with celluloid garbage 
The script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... 
Scrutiny 
On the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing 
Give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed . 
An imaginatively mixed cast 
The full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead

Did n't smile . 
Satisfy 
The story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
At a tough-man contest 
Be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely 
Infantile cross-dressing routines 
Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
'll only put you to sleep . 
Cold light 
Based on dave barry 's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters ' moves and overlapping story . 
Is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film 
More than that , it 's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
A technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team 
, the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
Be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing 
Funny situations 
As those monologues stretch on and on 
Is a career-defining revelation 
Is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities 
Make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
And sickening product placement 
Of the startling intimacy 
Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
A cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
Enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment .

Farts , urine

While i ca n't say it 's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie .

Refreshed 
Lifeless execution . 
Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet 's `` house of games '' and last fall 's `` heist '' so much fun 
An art film 
Echoes 
Including a knockout of a closing line 
A strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man 
A harrowing account 
Predictably 
Bland , surfacey 
Admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies 
Belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public 
What 's infuriating about full frontal 
The buoyant energy level 
Think that 's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline 
When various characters express their quirky inner selves 
Few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog 's works 
That 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny 
To cram earplugs 
, it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season . 
's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .

Runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
Just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
After only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers 
's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels 
Real women have curves '' is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she 'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams .

A gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . 
Uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt 
The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her 
( than leon ) 
Provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee 
Its intended audience -- children -- 
The film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it 
Be forgettable if it were n't such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play 
Ca n't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album 
How desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were 
Enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor 
Like you 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer 
Fuzziness 
Plain lurid 
Very believable 
A sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
Her tragedies 
Waking coma 
Terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences 
They will have a showdown , but , 
A refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films 
Giving it a strong thumbs up 
No satisfaction 
The tear-jerking demands 
Is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves 
Like acid 
Shallow and glib 
By turns very dark and very funny 
This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad . 
The bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and 
A different and emotionally reserved type 
Engaging criminal 
Groundbreaking endeavor 
Enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
Is really all about performances 
The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , 
The baseball-playing monkey 
As stiff , ponderous and charmless 
's pretty stupid . 
Of the worst dialogue 
No amount of imagination , 
Go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike 
Its chosen topic 
Vivid imagination 
One terrific score 
Rah-rah 
Brutally honest 
The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious 
Too few laughs 
Thoughtless , random , superficial humor and 
Oddly whimsical 
Freshman fluke 
As many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin 's film serves up with style and empathy 
Seemingly 
Ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and 
Dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
Worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles 
To add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb 
More repetition than creativity 
Designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense 
Flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set 
Was essentially , 
Anything fresh 
The film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys ' direction is clever and insightful 
Penetrating 
As intelligent 
The emotions seem authentic 
Sexy and 
The hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags 
A solid movie 
The worthy successor 
Captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper . 
Of the best films 
Wit and warmth 
Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
Its low groan-to-guffaw ratio 
Difficult , endless 
, super troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
At one man 's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois 
Does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style -- casting excellent latin actors of all ages -- a trend long overdue 
Good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there 's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat . 
Will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
A loose , poorly structured film 
Faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , `` a walk to remember '' succeeds through sincerity . 
The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on b��ttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history 
Juicy soap opera 
A charming but slight comedy . 
You see it in these harrowing surf shots 
The irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts 
Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
, however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
To this film that may not always work 
A remarkable amount of material in the film 's short 90 minutes 
Admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent 's complaint 
Might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog 
Only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind 
's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
Rank frustration from those 
Gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill 
Is filled with strange and wonderful creatures . 
The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
Failed jokes , twitchy acting 
This is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
Is that rare animal known as ' a perfect family film , 
One hopes mr. plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
Structured and 
's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles 
Angel 
Just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market 
The power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile 
Lacks in outright newness 
Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
Rich detail condensed 
Just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through 
Does n't have a single surprise up its sleeve .

More tacky and reprehensible 
A great performance and a reminder of dickens ' grandeur 
The cockettes ) provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . ' 
As a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit 
Enormously good 
But one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time 
Is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters 
Offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor 
Hollywood war-movie stuff 
, like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
Wafer-thin movie 
Seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum 
Establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids 
That we really have n't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's reign of fire 
That gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel 
Understated performances of ( jack nicholson 's ) career . 
That i 'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again 
True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
Poignant and wryly amusing film 
The historical , philosophical , and 
Miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life 
Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics 
Much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
Eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons 
Patchy combination of soap opera , 
These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and 
Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film 
The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes 
A sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception . 
The wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and 
His surprising discovery 
Children 
Served up with heart and humor 
Bring their characters to life 
, poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull 
Works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful 
An awfully good , achingly human picture . 
Take on the upscale lifestyle 
Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation 
So insanely stupid , so awful 
Coma 
Guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort 
Is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn 
Takes a hat-in-hand approach 
Always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story 
I 'm not , and then i realized that i just did n't care 
Captures a life interestingly lived 
Has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out 
And it is . 
Most uncanny 
, you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
Emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking 
Tender sermon 
We had no trouble sitting for blade ii . 
Secondhand , 
One could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
To the edge of your seat , tense with suspense 
Overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph 
'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i do n't see the point . 
Have been lost in the translation 
, dramatized pbs program 
I know i should n't have laughed , but 
Abject suffering 
A comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop 
's not that funny -- 
Retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him 
The visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive 
Is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious 
Skip the film and 
Compels 
Rich historical subject 
Put up with 146 minutes of it 
Sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special 
Finds warmth

Love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
Liking showgirls 
A film , and such a stultifying , 
Bad film 
Under cars 
Susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up 
The best performance from either in years 
A terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project 
Mushy as peas 
Undercut by the voice of the star of road trip 
Right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together 
A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
Fantasies 
The ranks 
Survive a screening with little harm done 
May not have the highest production values you 've ever seen 
, the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion . 
Sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead 
A refreshingly smart and newfangled variation 
If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . 
Yeah 
Been done before but never so vividly or 
The bodily function jokes are about what you 'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
With fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope 
Really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
Ploddingly sociological commentary 
Is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it 's more than a worthwhile effort 
Just does n't make sense 
Myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign 
The highest production values you 've ever seen 
Exuberance 
Is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 
Na?vet�� and arbitrary flashbacks 
Will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
A stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish 
The story relevant in the first place 
Heart or conservative 
Unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness 
Careless 
Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding 
Paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal 
Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
See `` blue crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings 
That rohmer still has a sense of his audience 
Lightweight 
Works superbly here 
Period-perfect 
An uncomfortable movie 
Crimes 
Constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . 
It 's more enjoyable than i expected , though , 
A rock-solid little genre picture 
An inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut 
Deliciously 
Bring off 
Have given it a one-star rating 
She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl 
Mr. deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
You have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort 
A film so cold and dead 
Its director 's cut glory 
Suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction 
Directs , ideally capturing the opera 's drama and lyricism 
Seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms. mirren , who did ) 
Gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry 
If it 's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch . 
Able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history 
The following things are not at all entertaining 
To create images you wish you had n't seen 
Excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope . 
Burnt-out 
With talent 
Rush through 
It just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen 
Recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt 
Keeps you 
That rare family movie -- 
Have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches 
Rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart . 
Hoary dialogue , 
Oscar-sweeping 
Deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture 
Be disappointed 
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie 
Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable 
Deal funnier 
The first one charming 
Uplifter . 
So familiar you might as well be watching a rerun 
Did n't know what kind of movie they were making 
The performances are so overstated 
Cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels 
Without ( de niro ) , city by the sea would slip under the waves . 
Can be fertile sources of humor 
A caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny 
Death to smoochy is often very funny , but what 's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito 's misanthropic vision . 
No one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and 
The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
That might be best forgotten 
Rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
Leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
Sick and 
Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
... an interesting slice of history . 
Is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
( ferrera ) 
It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
Unusual power 
Shimmeringly lovely 
Wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . 
Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
Wears thin 
Be captivated , 
In remembrance 
The connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and 
So sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film 
Better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh 
Keep this fresh 
Reasonably creative eighth-grader 
The movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance 
It 's an entertaining movie , and 
, it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
Logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd 
That shockingly manages to be even worse than its title 
Unlikable , uninteresting , 
The plot is paper-thin 
Creepiness 
Is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness . 
Is just sooooo tired . 
Looks closely , insightfully 
The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . 
Modestly surprising 
A lot of flavor and spice 
`` analyze that '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
Stands out 
Phoned-in business 
Of the funniest motion 
Evolves 
A work of extraordinary journalism , 
The half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy 
Helped change a nation 
Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
Get the same love story and parable 
Exactly how bad 
In crisis 
Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it 's a spirited film and a must-see 
A guilt-free trip 
Like the wanderers and a bronx tale 
Overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama 
Meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen 
Unblinking work 
Her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair 
( a ) wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
Instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull 
Emerges in the front ranks of china 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers . 
Part of that delicate canon 
This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , 
One terrific story 
The story is predictable 
More interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
A movie you can trust 
It had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special 
, besides its terrific performances , is fontaine 's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
The home alone formula 
Is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings 
Horrid 
Shallow and immature character 
The best 
Real masterpiece 
Good little movie 
Exceedingly rare 
Comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .

A deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 
Itself , a playful spirit 
One of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt 
Real pleasure in its laid-back way 
Recommend 
Makes two hours feel like four 
, the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
Takes hold . 
A giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place 
The acting , for the most part 
's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness 
That 's a liability . 
Which is often preachy and poorly acted 
When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational ,

Manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- 
Live happily ever after 
Misogyny and unprovoked violence 
You drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
Wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening 
The ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work 
Talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires 
Flawed and brilliant 
To the serbs themselves 
Tender movements 
Feels cheated 
, wistful new film 
Both exuberantly romantic and serenely 
Continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio 
Schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins 
Old world war 
Court maneuvers 
Off the element of surprise 
Follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling 
Road to perdition does display greatness , and it 's worth seeing . 
A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely 
It possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything 
Is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback 's heidegger - and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
Spotty script 
There are great rewards here . 
Looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining 
The grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made 
A stately sense of composition 
One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
Actually clicks . 
It holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm 
Dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement 
Scripted 
Most devastating flaw 
Drop 
Feeling to it , but like the 1920 's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
Mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . 
More interesting 
The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier 's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( `` laissez-passer '' ) wears its heart on its sleeve 
Comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow 
Translation : ` we do n't need to try very hard . ' 
Is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
Intellect and 
Its worst 
Blithe exchanges 
, brisk delight 
Intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being . 
Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
` direct-to-video ' release 
If it were n't silly 
Woe 
A loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor 
Is n't that much different from many a hollywood romance 
Provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect 
Transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair 
More depressing than entertaining 
Takes hold and grips hard . 
It slow , predictable and not very amusing 
It otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clich��s 
Magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults 
Were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one 
See scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
Misses its emotions 
At meaningful cinema 
About morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich��s and borrowed images 
Succeeds primarily 
Too simple 
For instance , good things happen to bad people 
Smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise . 
Be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms ' anti- castro 
Of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists 
Is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , 
Consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny 
Quirky , slightly strange french films 
Funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work 
Undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos . 
Offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . 
Though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
Please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject 
This is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
Arliss howard 's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love 
Below is well below expectations . 
A good noir 
Familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . 
Disjointed 
May have to keep on looking . 
Enough energy and excitement 
's the russian word for wow !? ' 
Positively dreadful 
Of clich��s , depression and bad alternative music 
Of minor shortcomings 
Tumbleweeds 
Complete wash 
That 's neither completely enlightening , 
A terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . 
Spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
Emerge dazed , confused as to whether you 've seen pornography or documentary 
Value cash above credibility . 
Extravagant 
A wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time 
All leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
Is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . 
Puzzling 
Can out-bad-act the other 
Has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested . 
Sour little movie 
The four feathers comes up short 
A magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch 
Directorial tour de force 
With the inherent absurdity of ganesh 's rise 
Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure . 
Hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction 
Understatement 
Is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
Revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling 
A timid , soggy near miss 
And funky look 
It look like a masterpiece 
... post-september 11 , `` the sum of all fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
Where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream 
An ) 
It 's funny . 
Well acted by the four primary actors 
Like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
Must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
Offers winning performances and some effecting moments 
What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
This animated adventure 
As a pale successor 
Desperate miscalculation 
Of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree 
The audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
A fantastic dual performance from ian holm 
A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait 
Has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more 
Makes it worth checking out at theaters 
The best of the pierce brosnan james bond 
The abyss 
A winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
An interesting story 
Two hours feel like four 
Call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity . 
Survive a screening with little harm done , 
It 's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i 'd say the film works . 
Is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough 
If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright 
Relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
Seems contrived and secondhand 
Could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was 
Seriously intended 
Builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with 
's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars 
Proficient , dull

Absolute delight 
From a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor 
Wondrously creative 
Serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable 
Picture that illustrates an american tragedy 
Is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album 
The complex , politically charged tapestry 
Richly 
Majestic 
Its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters 
If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away . 
's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex 
Of its provocative conclusion 
Gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day . 
An intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties 
Has at least one more story to tell : his own 
Although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
's the sweet cinderella story that `` pretty woman '' wanted to be . 
By the sketchiest of captions

A modem that disconnects every 10 seconds 
Change a nation

To truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy 
' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
Almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun 
Who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot 
That held my interest precisely because it did n't try to 
Several cliched movie structures 
Where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
Makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy 
Frustrating patchwork

Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? 
A vivid , spicy footnote to history , and 
Sensational 
Don 
Were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is 
Made it dull , lifeless , and irritating 
This '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight . 
Picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
That can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) 
Directed without the expected flair or imagination 
Tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances 
Cuba gooding jr. valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
Draws you in 
Fatal script error 
Is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema

Ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot

Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired

Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and 
Presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet 
Authentic account of a historical event

Form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change 
Too simple and 
As the old saying goes , because it 's true 
Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose . 
Loses sight of its own story 
The kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on showtime 's ` red shoe diaries 
So it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , 
Gets added disdain for the fact 
Like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead 
Treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . 
Funny bones tickled 
Less ambitious 
A voice for a pop-cyber culture 
Messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments 
Literate

Written so well 
Strangling the life out 
As the movie traces mr. brown 's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .

Be as lonely and needy 
So poorly 
Refined piece 
Entirely witless and inane , 
That the material is so second-rate . 
Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
The film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
It might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
A straight-ahead thriller 
A likable story , 
Dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious 
In part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin 
Uncertain

Ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway 
Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline 
The performances are amiable and committed

Rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop 
Death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .

Fussing over 
Could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker 
Saving grace 
Since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie 
Anything special , save for a few comic turns , 
Sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
Any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media 
Makes it worth watching 
To have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation 
Its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case 
The history is fascinating 
Last 15 minutes 
Put so much time and energy into this turkey 
As a vehicle to savor binoche 's skill , the film is well worthwhile .

Reality shows for god 's sake

Sorry use of aaliyah in her one and 
Old college try 
A bad movie 
Propaganda film 
Distressingly rote 
A timeless and unique perspective 
A sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really is n't . 
Formulaic , 
The skills of a calculus major at m.i.t. 
Despite the surface attractions -- conrad l. hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
I would leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered 
Have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling 
Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda . 
Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock 's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
About which you can actually feel good 
A wildly entertaining scan of evans ' career . 
Turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
Is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
Ache by the end of kung pow 
A welcome improvement 
Narcissism 
None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny . 
Its unsettling prognosis 
Is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand 
The script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul 
It has its faults , 
Where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad 
An engaging mystery 
Sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics 
They come , already having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
Handsome widescreen photography 
Is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
Visual charm or texture 
More of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought 
A culture-clash comedy 
Leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken 
Relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty 
's defiantly and delightfully against the grain 
The trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
Where story is almost an afterthought 
A conventional but heartwarming tale . 
Formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe 
Communicates something 
The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
The attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility 
I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere . 
More of an ordeal than an amusement 
Delivers what it promises : a look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . 
Foul up shum 's good intentions 
Bombs 
Dramatic comedy

It is a great film . 
From terry gilliam 's subconscious , pressed through kafka 's meat grinder and into bu?uel 's casings

Tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end 
The demented mind 
Sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that 
Plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties 
Flavorful performances 
A formula comedy redeemed by its stars ,

Strange it is , but delightfully so 
A great monster movie 
A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .

Great sympathy and intelligence 
Its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- 
Ingratiating 
In creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light 
's a lot of tooth in roger dodger 
Is shallow , offensive and redundant , 
It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started . 
Family fundamentals gets you riled up 
And sometimes dry 
Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog 's works , invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .

Deserving of discussion 
No character , 
The worst kind of mythologizing , 
As it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction . 
The worst of the entire franchise 
An incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
The roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful .

Robinson 's web of suspense

While the story goes nowhere 
It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
Apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device 
Of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own 
Will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay 
Visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction .

Full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .

Be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera 
See this delightful comedy 
Limp eddie murphy 
Tartly 
This gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
The movie is certainly not number 1 
Everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill 
Any shoddy product 
Sensitive acting 
Is a mess from start to finish 
Hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing 
To the actress , and to her inventive director 
One of those ` alternate reality ' 
To stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy 
Reasonably entertaining sequel 
Both a beautifully 
Desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s 
It may as well be called `` jar-jar binks : the movie . '' 
's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding 
Essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered 
A whole lot 
Boisterous 
A happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film 
Was so uninspiring 
Of control on a long patch of black ice 
Macaroni and cheese 
( denis ) accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film 
The previous movies 
Ugly and destructive little **** 
Does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen 
Invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series 
Told well 
An asian neo-realist treasure . 
Is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
Ever so gracefully 
Watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself 
A comedy to start a reaction 
Is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love 
Kong action cinema 
With a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing 
What starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
Eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark 
'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back 
It 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences 
The brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense 
Do n't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament 
Demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken 
Ca n't really call it a work of art 
Are so spot on 
The story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment 
With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they is n't 
's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days 
Is the one 
Stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering 
Then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars 
Is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
, it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
Of solid performances 
's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
German jewish refugees 
Is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string 
Real human soul 
Gives us mostly fool 's gold 
Keener is marvelous 
Energetic and always surprising performance 
Of its grand locations 
Get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees 
Has a `` what was it all for 
Does deliver a few gut-busting laughs 
-- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . 
Frankly , it 's pretty stupid . 
Their own comfortable niche 
Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
Have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
What 's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . 
You 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots 
Protective cocoon 
Seem heroic deserves a look 
Ultimately disappoint the action 
Refreshing and comical spin 
Reading an oversized picture book before bedtime 
A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
Achieves some kind of goofy grandeur 
Grandeur ' shots 
Hell-bent 
A modern motion picture 
The self-serious equilibrium 
It felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 
A headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar 's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation 
Strong voices 
The movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
Shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly 
Is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
Realism , crisp storytelling and radiant 
A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
Such a dungpile 
An unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism 
This film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget 
... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
Before it begins to fade from memory 
Yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
Successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie 
Very smart 
At least a minimal appreciation 
New inspiration 
Slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease 
Terrorism 
Humane 
Is impossible 
Up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms 
Elaborate futuristic sets 
Is boring 
The good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but 
The standards of knucklehead swill 
Of dramatic enlightenment 
From the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud 
You 're going to face frightening late fees 
Bring you into the characters 
The entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
're in for a painful ride 
Issues ' 
Numb experience 
Fun adventure movie 
A bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
Empty , purposeless 
Emphasis 
If you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
Rushed 
Has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers 
Befuddled 
Has a good line in charm 
It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 
The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes 
Afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn 
A landmark in film history 
Finding their way to joy 
Can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it 
A smart and funny 
By childlike dimness and a handful of quirks 
More fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer 
When they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
Knows everything and answers all questions , 
New testament stories 
Gets too cloying 
It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
Because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out 
Find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
Play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking 
That ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore 
Too deep or substantial . 
Based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior 
That helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games 
Ill-advised and poorly 
's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground 
Ideas and awkwardness 
Usual spielberg flair 
A film neither bitter nor sweet 
Nothing happens , and 
Badly cobbled 
Clarity and deeply 
The refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm 
, empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
Are pure hollywood 
An elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
Has the disadvantage of also looking cheap 
's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair 
Merrily 
Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
Past love story derisions 
It may ... work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
More than a whiff of exploitation 
Style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story 
Of impact and moments 
A rip-off of the matrix 
Probably should 
An escapist confection that 's pure entertainment . 
Nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life 's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced 
Tedious and turgid 
Is so anemic 
He gives none to the audience 
Very top rank 
's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
Are every bit as distinctive as his visuals 
An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
Powerful commentary 
Is a weirdly beautiful place 
You do n't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
Creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees . 
Mindless and 
Shindler 
As hannibal would say , yes , ` it 's like having an old friend for dinner ' . 
An amused indictment of jaglom 's own profession . 
Manages to incorporate both the horror 
Though it 's not very well shot or composed or edited 
Mostly plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
The ensemble has something fascinating to do 
Catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness 
Intelligent , and humanly funny film 
` top of the world ' 
Smeary and 
Is funny , insightfully human and 
Future-world 
By its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters 
Despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
Is supposed to be madcap farce . 
With but they 're simply not funny performers 
Change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat 
Too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer 
Sequences boring 
No point in extracting the bare bones of byatt 's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance 
These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and 
We hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
Bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work 
Appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich�� . 
Compelling , provocative and prescient 
( `` safe conduct '' ) is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage 
Mean-spirited and 
( a ) real pleasure in its laid-back way 
Start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line 
Plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises 
Pushiness and decibel 
Rich and sudden 
Most consumers of lo mein and general tso 's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
Of love and companionship 
Its accumulated enjoyment 
Lifetime milestones 
Of pleasure or sensuality 
A film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director

For excitement 
Armed with a game supporting cast 
Often-funny 
Fails to entertain 
The film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . 
Be patient with the lovely hush ! 
, nuanced 
Remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective 
Debts 
The endlessly repetitive scenes 
Is better than most of the writing in the movie 
The film is a fierce dance of destruction . 
Pulpy 
It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious 
Orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
Stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king 
Australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
Wonderfully creepy 
Of a particularly nightmarish fairytale 
The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and 
For the marquis de sade set 
) gorgeous 
Is truly gorgeous 
The awful complications 
Enough said , except : film overboard ! 
Michel piccoli 's moving performance 
A noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code 
In fact , even better . 
This argentinean ` dramedy ' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
An incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar 
To let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out 
When poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours 
Please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies 
One lousy movie . 
, it 's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
Little less bling-bling and a lot more romance 
Amazingly evocative film 
A movie instead of an endless trailer 
With dickens ' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath 's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 
New york 's finest and 
Any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions 
It 's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor 
Might as well be watching a rerun 
's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
The punch lines that miss 
A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
For the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 
, i 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
Of ` laugh therapy ' 
Cynicism every bit 
Made to look bad 
Well-developed characters 
Delightful mix 
Dog soldiers does n't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it . 
The breezy and amateurish feel 
Treachery 
Worry 
Balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
On the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time 
Berry 's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making `` die another day '' one of the most entertaining bonds in years 
The adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner 
Are frequently too dark to be decipherable 
Ensure that the film is never dull 
The tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals . 
For the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations 
's this rich and luscious 
Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
Putters 
's nothing resembling a spine here 
Failure 
Dramatic things happen to people 
The hardy spirit of cuban music 
Lumpy as two-day old porridge 
Whiny 
Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . 
Is too mainstream 
That the new film is a lame kiddie flick 
Secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
Been there , done 
's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year 
Will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic 
Unrewarding collar 
Appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time 
Smart and entirely charming 
Forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos 
Sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless 
A hugely rewarding experience 
An uneven mix 
Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
Can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time 
Woefully 
Could have been much stronger 
Is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
Duck the very issues it raises 
Possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything 
Much stronger 
Predisposed to like it 
With no obvious escape 
Get out 
's the sweet cinderella story that `` pretty woman '' wanted to be 
Ultimate blame 
Good sweat 
Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek 
Nearly every attempt at humor 
Your first instinct is to duck 
An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily 
Filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
Its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes 
Tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and parker 's creative interference ... 
Strenuous 
Make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe 
A refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort 
Is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon 
Pretty good 
Not to be dismissed 
When the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
More tiring than anything . 
Satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation 
That haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
Pokes , provokes , 
Remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film 
Authentically vague 
Has no place to go since simone is not real 
The thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written 
Often intense 
Baked cardboard 
Poorly written 
Overly sillified plot 
Textbook lives 
After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
Interesting technical 
Is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema 's master craftsmen 
At its worst 
Rotting underbelly 
So bleak 
The paper-thin characterizations and facile situations 
Be low , very low , very very low , 
An intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives .

This charming , thought-provoking new york fest 
An appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic 
Many clich��s 
Dry humor and jarring shocks 
Pallid horror 
Captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
The whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects 
Exciting plot 
's already a joke in the united states 
About the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped 
A ` girls gone wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
Into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through 
Packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack 
Laugh-out-loud funny

Overinflated 
Half the fun of college football games 
Who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson 's creek 
Makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture 
A highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man 
Your toes wo n't still be tapping 
It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .

It is interminable 
A likable story , told with competence 
A marvelous performance 
Surprisingly affecting 
Displacement 
Ample 
Hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications 
Air conditioning and popcorn 
Guarantee that no wise men will be following after it 
Slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
Bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys .

An impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war

Insultingly simplistic 
With each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path .

Showtime 's uninspired send-up 
Beautifully produced film 
As much as i laughed throughout the movie 
A category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but was n't 
Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
Fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes 
Pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
Morally

Reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theaters 
Shocking in its eroticized gore 
That those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home 
After being snared in its own tangled plot 
The melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy 
Grow impatient 
A breathtakingly assured and stylish work 
Another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls 
Truly awful and

Weak claims

Well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant 
Sleaziness

Slyly exquisite 
Of a happy ending

Common through-line 
Firmly 
Could n't recommend this film more . 
While cherish does n't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it 's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
With us is a minor miracle 
For silly summer entertainment 
What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
Offers absolutely nothing i had n't already seen .

It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
To affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror

A bit on the skinny side 
To remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be

Is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
Has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone 
To keep the film entertaining 
Characters are both overplayed and exaggerated 
The sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
Are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze

A decent popcorn adventure 
Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it 
Imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 
Sorvino is delightful in the central role . 
The worst movie of 2002 
Boisterous energy 
With grace and panache 
Truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together 
Takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and 
Takes a fresh and absorbing look 
Generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
What hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light 
Venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece 
Is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema 's master craftsmen . 
Of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness 
With laughs 
Intriguing and downright intoxicating . 
Do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version 
Of a good movie ye who enter here 
Love and humility 
Resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture 
Deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride . 
No clue about making a movie 
Gag two or three times 
Intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening 
Of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy 
That manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
Gangster/crime comedy 
Precious little substance 
A noticeable lack of pace 
Doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans 
Perception , conviction 
Be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation 
Seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic 
I ca n't say it 's on par with the first one 
My own minority report is that it stinks . 
Most politically audacious 
The chateau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . ' 
Close to real life 
Scare any sane person away 
Practically every facet of inept filmmaking 
Jell into charm 
All add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
Is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors 
Sulky 
Get your money back 
So freely 
, pretentious 
Of the avant-garde fused with their humor 
It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny 
An ironically killer soundtrack 
Never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
Fascinating film 
Falls short in building the drama of lilia 's journey . 
The dark places of our national psyche 
The dry humor 
That 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song 
Inside the wave 
Who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized 
A calm , self-assured portrait 
Is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
Inoffensive 
Rigor 
As sharp 
Insufferably 
Exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be 
Of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with 
The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
, miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
Matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
Courageousness 
Despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow 
Foremost cinematic poet 
... a rather bland affair . 
Green ruins every single scene he 's in , 
Steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece 
Done-to-death 
It 's an effort to watch this movie , but 
Features fincher 's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley 's breasts -- 
Taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling 
An infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
Plutonium 
Is a distinct rarity , and an event 
Heartfelt and achingly real 
Based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis 
All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
An earnest try at beachcombing verismo 
Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack 
Should appeal to women 
Poor dana carvey 
Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture 
They need it to sell us on this twisted love story 
Frantic , virulent and foul-natured 
Magnificent jackie chan 
A remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically 
: stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
Richly rewarded 
Deadpan cool , wry humor and 
, it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . 
Sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet 
Two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected 
Of the most repellent things 
Perfect medium 
Rare imax movie 
Ultimately the story compels 
Thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
Belly laughs 
Come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s 
Been part of for the most part wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and parker 's creative interference 
There 's no real sense of suspense 
To mediocrity 
Intoxicating 
Is , in fact , so interesting 
Together frustrating 
Despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
Through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot 
Do n't entirely ` get ' godard 's distinctive discourse 
The power of love 
As emotionally grand 
The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , 
Works on no level whatsoever for me . 
Enormous 
The illogic of its characters 
Goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection 
A little more humanity 
As clear and reliable an authority on that 
When it is n't incomprehensible 
Action man clich�� atop wooden dialogue 
Into this somewhat tired premise 
Hollow , self-indulgent 
Thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere 
Mesmerizing one 
While the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances . 
Real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even 
This too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare 's macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
The most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i 've had in a while 
( a ) thoughtful , visually graceful work . 
At least a few good ideas and features some decent performances 
A seven rip-off 
Documentary-like credibility 
It 's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill 
Of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter 
The filmmakers ' paws , sad to say 
Every moment crackles with tension , 
A classical dramatic animated feature , 
Bowling you over 
... a true delight . 
A fair bit of vampire fun 
Old-fashioned but emotionally stirring 
Script error 
The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . ' 
Is n't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure 
Of the most politically audacious films of recent decades 
Splashed with bloody beauty as vivid 
Lacking any real emotional impact 
Many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience 
It 's an ambitious film , and 
Seeing something purer than the real thing 
Have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie 
Masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' 
Itself is small and shriveled 
Of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one 
Defies classification 
A fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard ... and the 1999 guy ritchie 
Not counting a few gross-out comedies i 've been trying to forget 
The , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance 
A movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
A good film 
Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone 
Story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
Nasty aftertaste 
Powerful and telling 
Torn apart 
Melodramatic mountain 
Human moments 
Entertaining documentary 
Marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel 
Like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , 
Is always welcome . 
On the surface a silly comedy 
Remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . ' 
Classical dramatic animated feature 
Clamoring for another ride 
Far too much 
Made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones 
A difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots 
A very well-meaning movie , and 
Remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift 
Moving and weighty depiction 
, the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
Overall the halloween series has lost its edge 
The movie rising above similar fare 
Premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and

Ca n't act 
The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
On its fairly ludicrous plot 
Be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors 
And narrative grace 
Is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening 
More fun watching a documentary 
Sly , sophisticated and surprising 
Ratliff 's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
Cassavetes thinks he 's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
Feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
Wanderers and a bronx tale 
Stench 
Is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks 
That 's just too boring and obvious 
Cheerfully 
I 've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close 
A mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
Is almost in a class with that of wilde himself 
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged 
Overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a bu?uel retrospective 
The richness 
A silly hack-and-slash flick 
Has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) 
Some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory 
Never having seen the first two films in the series , i ca n't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
Should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
The audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and 
This time , the hype is quieter , and 
The script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
Decent draft 
The film has an infectious enthusiasm and we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
Brilliantly played 
Got it right the first time 
Seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid 
Shrieky special effects 
High crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government / marine/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue 
The modern rut 
Are bad 
That wastes the talents of its attractive young leads 
Scathingly witty 
Bitchy 
So distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope 
Given up 
Ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out 
Pretention 
The film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie

Mending a child 's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty 
Retread story 
Avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up 
Be mesmerised 
Dumb , narratively chaotic , 
A delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it 's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow . 
At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
Through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings 
Sure , it 's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be 
Yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
High camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie 
Unfolds as sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form 
Are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock ( since sept. 11 ) 
Of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse 
A small gem from belgium 
A worthwhile documentary 
Wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence 
On sophisticated , discerning taste 
Right tone 
... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
Most excruciating 
To newcastle , the first half of gangster no. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood 
The increasingly diverse french director 
Boredom to the point of collapse 
This stuck pig 
Combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that 's not merely about kicking undead *** , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption . 
A humorless 
Provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc 
No one can hear you snore 
Sucks , but 
That transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
The script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . '' 
He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery 
Spiritless , silly and monotonous 
A superb performance 
Main asset 
Just two 
Beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances 
A long , unfunny one 
With the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations 
Far the worst movie of the year 
Low-budget 
Powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign 
Yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling . 
Good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
Spielberg 's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' 
Than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe

About schmidt is nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear .

Shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people 
Transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being 
Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
Are both overplayed and exaggerated 
The rock is destined to be the 21st century 's new `` conan '' and that he 's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal . 
That few movies are able to accomplish 
The beaten path , not necessarily for the better 
A deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic 
Getting there is not even half the interest . 
Favorably 
This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c. walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
Had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama 
The actors are humanly engaged 
Of empathy 
Leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered 
Thought-provoking and stylish 
Historically significant , 
As subtle and touching as the son 's room 
Put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d 
Into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide 
Lacks the spirit of the previous two , 
Are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front 
Ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter 's the thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat 
` synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
A bloated plot 
Classic theater piece 
My only complaint 
To dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
You can do no wrong with jason x. 
's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
A vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation 
For only 71 minutes 
An elegant visual sense and a talent

Buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or 
The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings 
To be a breath of fresh air 
Tries too hard 
Is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
Fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) 
Everybody loves a david and goliath story 
A lame romantic comedy 
The movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich�� . 
The writing is indifferent 
Will probably like it . 
Of his top-notch creative team 
When it 's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama 
Needlessly poor quality 
An enthralling , entertaining feature 
With its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set 
Lines , the impressive stagings of hardware 
Bewilderingly brilliant 
With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .

It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but 
That both thrills the eye 
Mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device 
The acting is n't much better . 
It is n't particularly funny 
Are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters . 
'' comes from the heart 
Absorbing movie 
A well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ` direct-to-video ' release 
Enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film and 
Dystopian 
... a bland , pretentious mess . 
The jokes are sophomoric , 
Well-timed explosion 
Creepy turn 
Though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle 
Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
With loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel 
Great actors hamming it up 
Delightful cast 
False , sitcom-worthy solutions 
Mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself 
Is too upbeat 
Modest masterpiece . 
Not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
A stylistic 
That avoids the cartoonish clich��s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type 
His story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle

A major waste ... 
A sports extravaganza 
Any scorsese has ever given us 
The only pain

Rather slow beginning 
A strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man . 
Document 
Lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's 
This is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
Is terrific 
Distressing 
A sub-formulaic slap 
The tears come during that final , beautiful scene 
Itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
Ear-splitting 
Vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
Better entertainment 
Storytelling feels slight . 
Guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today 
Is funny and pithy , 
Then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
Lingering death 
Did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery 
Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers 's title-bout features .

Its worthy predecessors 
Uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof . 
A zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild 
As such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots 
Something to be ` fully experienced ' 
Remarkable 
Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , 
Insightful about kissinger 's background and history 
-- definitely a step in the right direction 
Charming but slight comedy 
To rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop 
Tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents 
Gave me no reason to care 
Quietly hopeful 
Muy loco , but no more ridiculous 
Life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor 
A nice , light treat 
Inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography 
Perfect teaming 
More of the same old garbage 
Slow , 
Lacks the spirit of the previous two 
Fine performance 
That takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time 
For kids or their parents , for that matter 
A smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
If there 's no art here 
, surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
Who cares ? 
Painstaking 
, amusing and unpredictable 
While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
Bloodsucker computer effects 
The film is a hilarious adventure and 
Is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold 
The way a good noir should 
Creates something more beautiful than either of those films 
Is amazing 
Your typical junkie opera 
Summer audience 
There 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations 
The reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . 
Emotional power

Anemic , pretentious . 
's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey

Often strains 
A lunar mission with no signs of life 
Of badness 
Predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters 
Tackles more than she can handle 
` blue crush ' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 
Pulls off enough 
A surprisingly ` solid ' achievement

Transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange

We get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
Sketches 
Is essentially an extended soap opera 
True pleasure . 
's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary

A knockout of a closing line

Like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions 
Pleasant enough dish

Feels derivative 
It treats ana 's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
Loud , low-budget and tired 
Brings documentary-like credibility 
Comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
Listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again 
Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .

Satire and childhood awakening 
By men of marginal intelligence 
Brief pretentious period 
Auspicious feature debut 
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time 
Charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election 
Know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : 
For both the scenic splendor of the mountains 
It makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing . 
Effective 
Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor 
Incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud 
The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
Is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original .

The film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
Somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
So well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be

An energetic , extreme-sports adventure 
Oddly fascinating 
At its best 
`` white oleander , '' the movie , is akin to a reader 's digest condensed version of the source material . 
Will find little new here 
Form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people 
Fanciful , 
One-trick pony 
None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny 
Predictably melodramatic . 
Soulful and

Perfunctory conclusion 
Is perfectly creepy and believable 
With moments of genuine insight into the urban heart 
Relaxed in its perfect quiet pace 
Reverie 
Proved too difficult 
It 'll probably be in video stores by christmas , 
've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement 
Sad to say 
Is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
Takes its techniques into such fresh territory 
Plot and paper-thin supporting characters 
Post-war art world 
Dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
That embraces its old-fashioned themes and 
A bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing 
Insultingly unbelievable 
A rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking 
A bit of a cheat in the end

Half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy 
A miraculous movie , i 'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion . 
Troubling 
The fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
A well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
Maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it .

Of obligatory cheap 
So pertinent and enduring 
Is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide

Lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers 's title-bout features 
The power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , 
Co-writer/director peter jackson 's expanded vision 
Remove spider-man the movie 
Cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy 
Which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain 
The film works 
The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed . 
Intriguing movie experiences

While failing to find a spark of its own 
Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
Refined

Is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout 
Off as annoying rather than charming 
More self-absorbed women than the mother and 
Fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
Fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels

Turn bill paxton into an a-list director 
The best date movie 
Disgusting . 
Derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded

Michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here 
Disaster flick 
Is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot 
Solid , spooky entertainment 
Piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
Very shapable but largely unfulfilling 
It also has many of the things that made the first one charming .

Fairly trite 
Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry 
It 's fun , but it 's a real howler 
Ignorant 
Is a big letdown 
Recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
Offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
Is about as interesting 
Nearly terminal case 
Overlong documentary 
A poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
Little doubt 
About as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season 
The fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and

Hide the fact that seagal 's overweight and out of shape 
All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but 
You laugh once ( maybe twice ) 
Maggots crawling on a dead dog 
Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix 
The artistry of making a film 
Cho 's timing is priceless . 
Much interest 
More bluster 
The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . 
Generous and subversive artworks 
A boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours 
Almost as much as they love themselves 
There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title . 
Succeeds mainly 
Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection 
It will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation 
Than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates 
It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
The astute direction of cardoso 
Sentimentality and annoying 
Winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel 
Go around , with music and laughter 
Crisp clarity 
Your ice-t 's from your cool-j 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california 
It begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy 
The direction of spielberg 
Fascinating , bombshell documentary 
Does best 
Can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis . 
Delightfully charming -- and totally american 
Amnesiac 
Treads heavily

Maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards . 
The familiar topic of office politics 
's all surface psychodramatics 
Not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick 
Because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
Is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
's not particularly well made 
Directing with a sure and measured hand , ( haneke ) steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 
Beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing 
Since freddy got fingered 
Shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
The viewer 's patience 
Rich promise 
Anarchist maxim 
Is long on 
Two fine actors , morgan freeman and 
Rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 
The leads are natural and lovely 
Hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters 
Once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting 
That this should seal the deal 
High crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government / marine/legal mystery 
Is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
An unbalanced mixture 
, the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
Nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film ... it 's not even a tv special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break 
On top of a foundering performance 
Wasting 
By the incredibly flexible cast 
It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style . 
Fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters 
Make a nice coffee table book 
Ends so horrendously confusing 
Golden book 
So far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true 
Simple-minded and 
Alert , if not 
Is sordid and disgusting 
The incessant use 
The same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends 
It is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
Nothing about them is attractive . 
The performers are so spot on 
Its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
A film less 
A lovely film for the holiday season 
The increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history . 
Urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
A head-turner -- thoughtfully written 
The comedy equivalent 
Through with originality , humor and pathos 
Of this unique director 's previous films 
Some outrageously creative action 
A squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly 
Pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons 
Combined with stunning animation 
Cranky 
Become one of our best actors 
( carvey 's ) characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
Every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
The most beautiful , evocative works i 've seen 
Unfortunately , kapur modernizes a.e.w. mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks `` the four feathers '' bare . 
Hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 
A nicely understated expression of the grief 
The relationship between reluctant 
Is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads 
Much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing 
Always entertaining , and smartly written 
An adoring , wide-smiling reception 
Is authentic 
I would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's forget paris . 
Is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
Enough to sit through crap like this 
A little scattered 
Ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles 
Made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances 
It 's a ripper of a yarn 
The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
In-depth portrait 
Entertaining and suggestive 
The demons of his own fear and paranoia 
At the very least 
Intermittently powerful study 
You 'll enjoy the hot chick . 
Racist portraits 
Creating an intriguing species of artifice 
By the sea would slip under the waves . 
I thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love ` real ' 
Has really done his subject justice . 
If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout 
Misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
Not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
To a t. 
Cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
Male hip hop fantasy 
Becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence 
Bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults 
A great yarn 
Rooted 
Soderbergh 's best films , `` erin brockovich , '' `` out of sight '' and `` ocean 's eleven , '' 
's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction 
Sweetness and vulnerability 
The muckraking , soul-searching spirit 
, it 's badder than bad . 
Offers a trenchant critique of capitalism 
Well-paced and ultimately 
Stellar performance 
Best disney movie 
Flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism 
Cardboard characters and performers 
Will have fun with 
This crude , this fast-paced and this insane 
Will eat up like so much gelati 
Especially give credit to affleck . 
The movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
Been this disappointed by a movie in a long time 
Inevitable and 
The cleverest , 
An interesting bit of speculation 
Feel better already . 
Its leaden acting 
Teen-sleaze equivalent 
From being a complete waste of time 
Is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . '' 
As the direction is intelligently accomplished 
But no . . 
's a pretty woman 
's low on both suspense and payoff 
Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , 
Good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there 's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat 
Fumbles away 
, overlong soap 
A tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor 
Miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
To swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros 
Seems as deflated as he does 
Dumb gags 
A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged 
Several strong performances 
Harmless 
A lot of problems 
Congrats disney 
The film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
Is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story 
, it 's kinda dumb . 
Reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things 
In a slap-happy mood 
A sly female empowerment movie 
Half the excitement of balto 
Updating white 's dry wit to a new age 
The movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
Dismiss 
Rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes 
Take the warning literally 
A thriller 
Particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy 
Energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested . 
From 
On no level whatsoever for me 
Consistently funny 
Equally engrossing 
Looks and feels tired 
A reasonable degree of suspense 
Turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film 
A brief amount 
A heaven 
To create a film that 's not merely about kicking undead *** , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption 
Is like a beautiful food entr��e that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless 
Quiet , introspective and entertaining 
A bang-up job of pleasing the crowds 
Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , 
Opening up 
Told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
Is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned 
To stop watching 
Softheaded metaphysical claptrap 
Who paid to see it 
Less than fresh 
A triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
You 'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for 
Rarely , a movie is more than a movie . 
We 've liked klein 's other work but rollerball left us cold 
To see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
The performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
Offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people 
A seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili . 
An overly sillified plot and 
Becomes long and tedious 
Are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
Intermittently wise 
Some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , 
Writer and director otar iosseliani 's pleasant tale 
Is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
Is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
A hilarious ode to middle america 
The funniest jokes of any movie 
Derailed 
The problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources . 
Animation work 
I found it weirdly appealing 
Do justice 
Is extremely funny 
Inconsequential road-and-buddy pic 
That is fully formed and remarkably assured 
, you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
Peels layers 
Nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he 'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego 
Bloody 
Are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely 
Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
In tired stereotypes 
So perfect for a ballplayer 
Wise 
When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails 
Imaginary 
This film has an ` a ' list cast and some strong supporting players 
Flawed humanity 
Ame and unnecessary . 
Watch robert deniro belt out `` when you 're a jet

The long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped 
A great writer 
Messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd 
Though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
The chaotic horror 
The directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor 's doorstep . 
Full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s 
Record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse 
By humanity 's greatest shame 
Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
Incredibly flexible cast 
Is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
Tanks . 
Corrupt 
Romething 's really wrong with this ricture ! 
Really strong second effort 
You want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
Of french cinema 's master craftsmen 
I would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed 
Grinds itself 
All the way to the credits 
A winning comedy with its wry observations 
The most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time 
Awarded mythic status 
Tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic . 
, very good 
Fun with it all 
, thoughtful , unapologetically raw 
This film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable 
Much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice . 
Has performed a difficult task indeed 
Consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
Repetitious 
A freedom 
As a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller 
With lingering questions about what the film is really getting at 
Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , 
Powerful and reasonably fulfilling 
Is driven by appealing leads 
A halfwit plot 
All too familiar ... 
In self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue 
A mess from start to finish 
A teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama 
Hide a weak script 
, dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
Abject 
The director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling 
Decisive 
Adobo 
They grow up and you can wait till then 
Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen 
The topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end 
Approach to the workplace romantic comedy .

Are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ... 
Profits 
Sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
Breathe out of every frame 
As a remake , it 's a pale imitation . 
Expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy 
Has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should 
Notable 
Breezy movie 
The first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content 
Terrifically entertaining 
Charms are immediately apparent 
A coming-of-age movie that hollywood would n't have the guts to make . 
Robust 
Because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas 
Looks genuinely pretty 
Elegantly appointed 
's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety 
Fascinating they may be as history 
Winning and wildly fascinating work 
's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
A long patch of black ice 
Odd and weird 
This oscar-nominated documentary 
Too burdened by the actor 
Give the movie points for 
That only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome 
See clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . 
Of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep 
Thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer 
Bloated 
Its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care 
Intelligent and 
An elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- 
To the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
Turn on many people to opera 
Ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
Substandard 
The characters are so generic and 
Director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , 
Eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material 
A tremendous , offbeat sense 
With taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field 
The first fatal attraction was vile enough . 
To be dismissed 
Ridiculous action sequences 
In a bad-movie way 
Written by somebody else 
Loses its overall sense of mystery 
Mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday 
Of the better video-game-based flicks , 
Real shame 
Often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness 
Its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through 
Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , 
Low-brow 
Is phenomenal , especially the women . 
Whimsical humor 
That makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare 
Positive change 
Obsessive 
Hilariously raunchy as south park 
Lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing 
New energy 
Is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid 
Would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
Has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots 
, kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust . 
Even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end 
Oftentimes funny , 
I do n't know what she 's doing in here 
Great fun 
The qualities that made the first film so special 
That 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads 
Do a load of good 
Drumline is its energy 
Is dicaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
Well-paced 
He has something significant to say 
Brian tufano 's handsome widescreen photography 
Horribly depressing and 
Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley 's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
A strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence 
, steven shainberg 's adaptation of mary gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
Like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
Laugther 
Be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows 
, this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
Is n't as funny as you 'd hoped . 
As a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
Bitter and less mature 
It 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies 
Suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance 
The occasional belly laugh 
Shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters 
Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune 
While certainly clever in spots 
To accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks 
Gives this aging series a much needed kick , making `` die another day '' one of the most entertaining bonds in years 
Evocative 
I do n't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
Where nothing really happens 
Worthy of our respect 
Successfully 
Has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon 
Advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching 
Between these two marginal characters 
They so heartwarmingly motivate 
Carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
A sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china 
Rising star jake gyllenhaal 
That suffers because of its many excesses 
Griffiths ' warm and winning central performance 
He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does 
A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot 
A truly larger-than-life character 
Action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest 
O fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and 
Seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , 
Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
As pure composition and form -- 
Family 
Formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
Intelligent jazz-playing exterminator 
Tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries 
Old 
For followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects 
Satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor 
A solidly constructed , entertaining thriller 
Suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
Clarity 
Turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic 
Frightening and compelling 
The first mistake 
Her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation 
Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
Naughty children 's 
Sophisticated film 
Offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future 
Warm , inviting , and surprising 
The film 's plot may be shallow , 
Vowing , ` this is going to be something really good 
With such a buoyant , expressive flow of images 
Out-of-kilter 
Grotesquely 
Mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance 
Are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
Rubber-face routine 
Allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... 
Is n't a new idea 
Bad stage dialogue 
Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings 
Picture-perfect 
Precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family . 
Duds 
Wonderfully sprawling soap opera 
Foul substances 
Fairly unsettling scenes 
Of character-driven storytelling 
Beautiful film 
Darned if your toes wo n't still be tapping 
Cheapening 
Of its marks 
Gets sillier , not scarier , 
Examines crane 's decline with unblinking candor . 
So aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
Uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory 
Would be a total washout 
Foreign culture only 
Impressive images 
Stock plot 
More irresistibly than in ` baran 
Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and i know this because i 've seen ` jackass : the movie 
, tasteless and idiotic 
The talented cast generally 
A fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . 
, ` naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
To shine 
A renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor 
You might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer 
Live together 
Somewhat less than it might have been 
Crowd pleaser 
Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
Control-alt-delete 
Of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant 
Storytellers 
Be spectacularly outrageous 
's not to like about a movie with a ` children 's ' song that includes the line ` my stepdad 's not mean , he 's just adjusting ' ? 
Never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
Are served with a hack script 
Appeals to me 
I 'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid 
Dogs 
A highly spirited , imaginative kid 's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god 
A young boy 
Moving and vibrant 
After 30 minutes into a slap-happy series 
Fails on so many levels 
Which become strangely impersonal and abstract 
Disturbance or detached pleasure 
Druggy and self-indulgent , 
Gorgeous pair 
Is oscar-worthy . 
Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... 
Lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay 
Of misogyny and unprovoked violence 
, ugly and destructive little **** 
Perfect black pearls 
Is n't 
A non-stop funny feast of warmth , color and cringe 
Want to check it out 
In search of a better movie experience 
Unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn 
Takes great pleasure 
Work in concert 
Burns 's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen 
Enough freshness 
Rude and profane 
's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
Sanitised and 
Levity 
Should dispel it 
At least three dull plots 
Filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots 
More predictable than their consequences 
's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime 
Be found a tough beauty 
I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere 
Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
Far more entertaining 
Before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm 
Bland to be interesting 
Certainly was n't feeling any of it 
If `` lilo & stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
Familiar you might as well be watching a rerun 
But something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence 
Rifkin 's references are ... impeccable throughout . 
Escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , 
Scratch for a lesson in scratching 
Like it was worth your seven bucks 
Is pretty much the same all over 
The delicious 
Mike shoots and scores 
The number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theaters 
Very minds 
Non-techies can enjoy 
Takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze 
Kosminsky ... puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
In mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty 
Should win the band a few new converts , too 
Deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich��-riddled genre can offer . 
No-holds-barred cinematic 
The banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group ... and never fails to entertain . 
That is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love 
The message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough 
Humor and heart and very talented young actors 
Its compelling mix 
An artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep 
That seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow 
In a give-me-an-oscar kind of way 
A pleasant enough dish 
What soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky . 
Of one unstable man 
We delight in the images 
Another gross-out college comedy -- ugh 
Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little **** . 
Superficially written characters ramble 
Hit on a 15-year old 
The high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged 
's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek 
A hopeless , unsatisfying muddle 
Will have an intermittently good time 
In watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers 
Is n't much there here . 
An impressive roster of stars and direction 
The most beautiful , evocative works 
Smugly 
Rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen 's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
Well-directed and 
A sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism 
Possible argentine american beauty reeks

Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . 
Fails as a dystopian movie , 
Respect 
` anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . ' 
There is enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
Has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome 
Like a non-stop cry for attention 
Uses very little dialogue 
Fluid , no-nonsense authority 
'll buy the soundtrack . 
The best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times 
That it was intended to be a different kind of film 
Of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism 
The plot makes no sense 
There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery 
Overwhelmingly positive portrayal 
The pathology it pretends to investigate 
Like the excruciating end of days 
Putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way 
A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
A wonderfully speculative character 
Leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject 
Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .

Desire to enjoy good trash every now and then 
Diesel is n't the actor to save it . 
's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing . 
What 's missing in murder by numbers 
For all audiences 
You can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
It 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
Of effecting change and inspiring hope 
With motionless characters 
Complex and quirky , but 
Comfort and familiarity 
Superior cast 
Is tuned in to its community . 
Talking a talk that appeals to me 
Being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
People who are enthusiastic about something and then 
Succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides . 
This 90-minute dud 
Is n't worth sitting through 
Passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment 
Like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown 
Of the most entertaining bonds in years 
Puts enough salt 
The movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick 
There are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; 
That everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar 
Get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell 
As well-written as sexy beast 
Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party . 
From a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood 
's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness . 
A lot of the credit for the film 's winning tone 
'll love this movie . 
Tear your eyes 
Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm 's performance 
Enough cool fun 
As sharp or as fresh 
A large dose of painkillers 
Of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence 
Can render it anything but laughable . 
It is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
A crisp psychological drama ( and ) a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old `` twilight zone '' episode . 
Distracted by the movie 's quick movements 
Worthy of her considerable talents 
We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
Morality , family , and social expectation 
An undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that 's what makes it worth a recommendation 
As it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
What it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera 
A smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr. drew barrymore 
In the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack 
Is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
, then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
The theme with added depth and resonance 
, skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
, haphazard theatrical release 
Degenerates into hogwash 
Rotten in the state of california 
Full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
Without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves 
Embarrassed to be part of 
Gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films . 
Makes oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest 
It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , 
When a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
Style-free 
Screen with considerable appeal 
It is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged . 
Inert sci-fi action thriller . 
The joyous , turbulent self-discovery 
You 'll love it and probably want to see it twice . 
Because australia is a weirdly beautiful place 
Fearless 
That it seems the film should instead be called ` my husband is travis bickle ' 
Cho 's previous concert comedy film 
Won my heart 
Laugh at how bad 
The best since the last waltz 
Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
Sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
Our eyes 
Ca n't recommend it 
Is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
Place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence 
Afterlife 
Rising

Malaise 
Energized 
Wonderous 
If you 're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
Seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
Finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
Pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . 
Structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic 
Holiday box office pie 
The powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material 
Come up with an original idea for a teen movie 
Look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
Like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing 
That it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another 
Does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong 
Is so self-pitying 
A mesmerizing cinematic poem 
Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things 
Of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films 
The bad guys 
Disguise the slack complacency of ( godard 's ) vision 
A rip-off twice removed

The dialogue is cumbersome , 
Embarrassment and 
Marveled 
Full 
Bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs 
More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .

It 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven 
Duvall is strong as always . 
She is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , 
A searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , 
A bit too eager to please . 
A film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship 
One word that best describes this film : honest 
Ms. shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
Molested 
Stands a good chance of being the big 
At such a furiously funny pace 
Target practice 
Popcorn thriller 
Astoundingly rich film 
Are certainly 
Is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
What ( denis ) accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 
Loosely-connected string 
Tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images 
Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve 
Imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen 
With an elegance and maturity 
's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror 
Movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
Presented with universal appeal 
Mr. nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity . 
Shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull 
Ruthless in its own placid way 
Robin williams , death to smoochy 
It is japanese and yet feels universal 
Safe conduct is anything but languorous . 
Expressive 
Become strangely impersonal and abstract 
Rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces 
Should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows 
Shining with all the usual spielberg flair 
Has n't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
That by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past 
Of jason x 
What it is -- a nice , harmless date film 
Far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but 
The experience worthwhile 
That werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken 
Like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic 
Shows the promise of digital filmmaking 
Amazing 
To remarkable performances 
Is remarkably dull with only caine 
Romp that 's always fun to watch . 
So that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails 
Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
Makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering . 
Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
In its yearning for the days 
Allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours 
The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
Would reach for a barf bag 
A truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film 
Gives gifts to grownups 
As sexy beast 
A good and ambitious film 
Dumb drug jokes and 
Pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens 
Value and respect 
Do n't notice the 129-minute running time 
Has something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation 
Through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams 
Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
As shameful 
Tenderness 
Unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck 
The rat-a-tat energy of `` his girl friday , '' maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes 
Is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
Seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them 
Of fun 
Sluggish , tonally uneven . 
Can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain 
Sumptuous ocean visuals and 
Drag the movie 
A smart , romantic drama 
The lengths to which he 'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego 
May fall fast asleep . 
Just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie 
Lousy one 
Pedro 
The whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
Davis ' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships 
That 's good 
As bad a film 
Satisfyingly scarifying , fresh 
, it 's a bargain-basement european pickup . 
Feel cheated 
He allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . 
Fidel castro 
A light-hearted way the romantic problems 
With an admirably dark first script by brent hanley 
Have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc 
Slap her - she 's not funny ! 
Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep 
I liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
Unbelievable 
Failing to find a spark of its own 
Delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
Is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure 
Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic 
Obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
Well-told 
Few things more frustrating to a film buff 
Is impressive . 
Filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
Waters it down 
There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
World war ii 
Cliched and contrived 
So that the human story is pushed to one side 
's black hawk down with more heart . 
Children 's ' song 
Give a pretty good overall picture of the situation 
Are , with the drumming routines , among the film 's saving graces 
A searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be 
Earnest emotional core 
Over-indulgent 
, his most personal work yet . 
Unlimited access to families and church meetings 
Do better elsewhere 
Refused 
Is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
Great american adventure 
Everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
Terrorist attacks 
Falls flat as a spoof . 
From a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups 
, this is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema 's master craftsmen . 
The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and 
An unexpectedly sweet story of 
Has none of the crackle of `` fatal attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 weeks '' , or even `` indecent proposal '' , and feels more like lyne 's stolid remake of `` lolita '' 
Amicable 
Strangely liberating 
Traditional 
Of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum 
Upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
The energy humming 
In need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars 
Bluff 
Is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
Surprisingly engrossing 
To sustain a laugh 
Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre . 
Very well-written and 
As a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped 
Its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
As warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
Happily 
Australia is a weirdly beautiful place 
The ingenious construction 
Overwhelming 
Enough charming moments 
A deficit of flim-flam 
Joke 
It will warm your heart , 
In charm 
Discovery and humor 
To inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable 
Baffled the folks in the marketing department 
Particularly balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents 
Are especially fine 
Pervasive 
The failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel 
Idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise 
Cast in impossibly contrived situations 
The familiar , funny surface 
Fascinate 
Who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior 
Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them 
, the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
Possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
A fullness that does not negate the subject 
A welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre 
With the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies 
A gamble and last orders are to be embraced 
This cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
Are becoming irritating . 
One of the worst of the entire franchise 
A selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
Middle eastern world politics 
He probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
Finn 
Holds the film 
Falls victim 
This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon . 
A dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem 
Amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing 
Funny bone 
Weirdly appealing 
Helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure 
Though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head 
A rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means . 
Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
And totally disorientated 
Wildly entertaining 
Creative instincts 
If it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor 
Remarkably accessible and haunting film 
Modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance 
Some good material 
Indulges in the worst elements of all of them 
It preaches 
Should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it 
During that final , beautiful scene 
Coming back from stock character camp 
Unfunny wannabe 
Suspense or believable tension 
Humorous and 
A no-bull throwback to 1970s action films 
Little mermaid 
Both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving 
Sheer dynamism 
Spectator 
Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer 
To her inventive director 
The proper conviction 
Contorting itself into an idea of expectation 
A risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy 
Beautiful food entr��e 
Director lee has a true cinematic knack , 
With first love sweetly 
Runs out of ideas 
Jar-jar binks : the movie 
Favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
A delightful comedy centering on food 
Is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
I suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- 
To win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics 
Of heart and unsettling subject matter 
If you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - 
Initially gripping 
A funny , triumphant , and moving documentary 
A fat man 's navel 
To speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short 
An entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids 
Been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 
The film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
Man clich�� 
Heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism 
Zany mix 
Raises some worthwhile themes 
Make 105 minutes seem twice as long 
Emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
Splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us 
Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap 
Smug 
Is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean 
's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies 
In a downward narcotized spiral 
Talented thesps 
Class bores 
There are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp 
Parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . 
Holds promise 
While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , 
Completely creatively stillborn 
Like a great missed opportunity 
A majestic achievement 
A film that 's not merely about kicking undead *** 
All comedy 
At how much we care about the story 
The tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
This woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
Truly larger-than-life 
Rather slow 
Since the thrills pop up frequently 
Pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script 
By the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived . 
Well loved classic 
A rich tale 
Vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 
Brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing . 
Dramatic substance 
The way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers 
The french lieutenant 's woman 
Are quite admirable 
, the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
Is entertaining on an inferior level 
Both lead performances are oscar-size . 
Are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy 
's great for the kids 
This pretty watchable 
Yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie 
Having a hard time believing people were paid to make it 
Visually bland 
The kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience 
Horrors 
Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . 
The recording sessions are intriguing , 
A well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ` direct-to-video ' release . 
Shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . 
The characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone 
Handled with intelligence and care 
Clare peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
Irritates 
At its utterly misplaced earnestness 
At its best 
Made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar 
So substantial or fresh 
Of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness 
Chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries 
Her subject matter 
The casting of raymond j. barry as the ` assassin ' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger 's impressive fake documentary . 
Rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
The potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo 
Too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes 
Pretentious mess . 
Make it worth watching 
Directs an equally miserable film the following year 
Their lack of chemistry 
A sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone 
The film 's strength is n't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
Most humane and important holocaust movies 
To give the film the substance it so desperately needs

Odd but ultimately satisfying

To burn every print of the film 
A lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud ... 
It irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
A bad-movie way 
Predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch 
Allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly 
Spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie . 
A terrible movie , 
Trimmed 
The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . 
The excitement is missing 
Numerous , world-renowned filmmakers 
First love sweetly 
Legendary 
The curse of a self-hatred instilled 
Lead performances 
Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls '' 
Creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical 
The spotlight 
Misanthropy 
It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
Marvelously 
A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action 
The movie should win the band a few new converts , too 
Tense 
The major problem with windtalkers 
Responsible for this illuminating comedy 
I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake 
Hollywood program 
No doubt , it 's the worst movie i 've seen this summer 
Often surprising twists and 
Cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and 
's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
Steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
Mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency . 
Are n't so substantial or fresh 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue 
Wheedling reluctant witnesses 
I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . 
This documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what ( evans ) had , lost , and got back . 
Taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history 
The ingenuity 
A winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone 
Honest performances and 
Movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly 
Of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle 
The positives 
In the broiling sun for a good three days 
, blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . 
Dimming 
Like brosnan 's performance , evelyn comes from the heart .

Was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something 
Truth-in-advertising hounds 
So low

`` red dragon '' is entertaining . 
12th oscar nomination 
Which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them 
Derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone 
Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up 
Appalling 
Very stilted in its dialogue 
Too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary 
A rip-off twice removed , modeled after ( seagal 's ) earlier copycat under siege 
Offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun 
As easy to be bored by as your abc 's 
Is always watchable . 
Small ... with considerable aplomb 
Creepy atmosphere 
Believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals 
Is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss 
Turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody 
Zero-dimensional , unlikable characters 
Warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people 
That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` dragonfly . '' 
Beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors 
Of the really bad blair witch project 
Furiously 
A tour de force of modern cinema 
As gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch 
Brilliant touches 
That most frightening of all movies 
Who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby 
How deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them 
Originality of plot 
There is plenty of room for editing , 
Would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is 
Is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
Be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild 
A special kind 
Would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic 
A cesspool 
The all-time great apocalypse movies 
For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , 
A new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
Ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls 
A moving story of determination and the human spirit 
To enhance the self-image of drooling idiots 
In such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end 
Contrived , unmotivated , 
Some very good comedic songs , 
Sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching 
That should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame 
Problematic characters 
Into an urban hades 
Good action , good acting , 
Farcically 
To the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food 
Love it , 
Deserves a chance to shine 
Its proper home 
A 90-minute movie that feels five hours long 
Me a lot of memento 
Plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
A lower i.q. 
It is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery . 
Comes off as insultingly simplistic 
Neat 
Above the level of an after-school tv special 
A smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the french revolution from the aristocrats ' perspective 
A knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
Captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could 
Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor 
Of the best of a growing strain of daring films 
Distanced us from the characters . 
Refreshing to see a romance this smart 
Shows moments of promise but 
The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
Urbane sweetness 
Manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life 
And refined piece 
Is consistently amusing and engrossing 
A joint promotion 
Something else altogether -- clownish and 
And damaged dreams 
Touching and funny 
( tries ) to parody 
Than a stifling morality tale 
, revolting 
This quirky soccer import is forgettable 
You instantly know whodunit 
You hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles 
Of an ignored people 
And thought-provoking film 
The film is well-intentioned 
On the cinematic front 
A xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc 
Far-flung , illogical , 
Four-star movie 
Everything else about the film tanks . 
Funny and wise 
Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , 
Adventurous indian filmmakers 
Stylish but steady , 
Has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . 
The quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker 
, the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
Accomplished actress 
Most accomplished work 
Saves it ... and makes it 
That 's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world 
Confused 
's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny 
Lot to recommend read my lips 
The pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - broadway play 
Have been astronomically bad 
Is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , 
By then , your senses are as mushy as peas 
It hates its characters . 
This might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their *** off for an hour-and-a-half . 
Difficult to fathom 
The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
Comedy and 
Genuine quirkiness 
Came up with a treasure chest of material 
Dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , 
... stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
Its demented premise 
An articulate , grown-up voice 
Alive and 
Whether or not 
Dour 
The best story 
Carries you along 
Put away the guitar , sell the amp , 
About nothing delivered by the former mr. drew barrymore 
With a twisted sense of humor 
The movie 's progression 
Has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written 
Explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere 
, this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . 
The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia 
Tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history 
Played for maximum moisture 
Has several strong performances 
Misconceived final 5 
The film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing . 
A weird and wonderful comedy 
Strands his superb performers in the same old story 
Is n't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other 
A mere plot pawn 
Powerful young actor 
Dark , gritty , sometimes funny 
It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet 
Term epic cinema 
If hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; 
The lack of linearity 
The new film of anton chekhov 's the cherry orchard 
Tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation 
Short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
They see the joy the characters take in this creed 
Natural affability 
Surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players 
One never overwhelms the other 
The upscale lifestyle 
Cannon 's confidence 
Sharp 
All those famous moments 
Their parents , wise folks that they are 
Overtly disagreeable 
Is nothing short of refreshing 
Who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely 
The wonder of mostly martha 
Despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . ' 
A perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator 
Provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride 
Become a spielberg trademark 
Harsh conceptual exercise 
Applying definition to both sides of the man 
The movie 's charm 
Does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendor that can be seen in other films 
Intelligence and subtlety 
A film 's title served such dire warning 
Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident 
Is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
A beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder 
Are still looking for a common through-line 
The film is essentially juiceless . 
You 're an elvis person 
Populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life 
Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants . 
It made me feel unclean 
So insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , 
Bogging down 
's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan 's prefeminist plight 
Ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie 
You 're far better served by the source material . 
Sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments 
He 's been in years 
While retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision 
, it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
The ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
Great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting 
What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . 
's not a great monster movie . 
Triumph over a scrooge or two 
's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness 
An encouraging effort from mccrudden 
Believe it or 
Fresh and absorbing 
A funny yet dark and 
Cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences 
During sunset 
Yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but 
The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , 
A wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace 
Of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
Will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them . 
What he 's already done way too often 
Come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals 
Goofy , nutty , consistently funny . 
Walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , 
By generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again 
Cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects 
Morally bankrupt 
Easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story 
To being very funny 
Are as timely as tomorrow 
To a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick 
Pure 
The low-grade cheese standards 
A hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey 
Is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
`` serious issues '' 
Is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists 
More compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn 
Director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime 's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
Would do better elsewhere 
Posey 
This junk 
A nice little story 
Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
Frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy 
Revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
A bittersweet contemporary comedy 
The comic effects of jealousy 
The powerful success 
Merges his collaborators ' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press 
Very sincere 
Lack contrast , are murky 
Funny film . 
Just die already 
Superficial midlife crisis 
As delightful 
Achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture 
That it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling 
Watchable stuff . 
Looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . 
As gripping 
The movie 's success 
Monsoon wedding

Girl entry 
Cliche-ridden 
Fathom 
Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . 
A mediocre movie trying to get out 
That somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton 
As if it were an obligation 
Creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- 
We never really get inside of them . 
Smarter offerings 
Is enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens 
Succeeded only in making me groggy . 
You 'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 
Under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight 
With great sympathy and intelligence 
In such a gloriously goofy way 
Are really surprising 
An addictive guilty pleasure 
Upper teens may get cynical . 
Is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
Deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy 
To the climactic burst of violence 
A good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department 
Pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde 
Little narrative momentum 
Cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump 
The film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture . 
Not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream 
Into one good one 
Sometimes funny 
Of relentlessly nasty situations 
Real characters 
Deserves a look 
An extraordinary 
That keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming 
It makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens 
Drag audience enthusiasm 
Obscenely 
A terrible story 
A dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers 
Rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except 
Airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe 
, the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor 
Deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context 
Be profane 
Achieves the near-impossible 
Some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights 
A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
Has not a trace of humanity or empathy 
Stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why 
More balanced or fair portrayal 
From its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , 
It was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did i miss something ? '' 
Far less enjoyable 
Beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people . 
Imax sound system 
Any flaws that come later 
This date-night diversion 
- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
Touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable 
Is one reason it 's so lackluster . 
Can not be revived . 
Artificial suspense 
Is the score , as in the songs translate well to film 
A lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's 
Are what makes it worth the trip to the theater 
Nothing about crime

With nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties 
To work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house 
It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches 
Than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap

The awe in which it holds itself 
To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
First-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real americans '' 
A journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick ,

The plan to make enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a souffl�� gone wrong . 
Although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another major league . 
A social injustice , at least 
If you love reading and/or poetry , then by all means check it out . 
If the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material . 
There 's an admirable rigor to jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but 
Taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock 's imaginative flight to shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff 
Serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm 
To be something of a sitcom apparatus 
Than a worthwhile effort 
You could hate it for the same reason . 
Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .

So much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny 
Of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues 
Are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and

Nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album 
All ages -- a movie that will make you laugh 
Harps on media-constructed ` issues ' 
It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 
Has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence 
The actors are simply too good , and 
Stains 
Flopped as surely as a souffl�� gone wrong 
Some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat . 
Effecting change 
A remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
Rich visual clarity and deeply 
Have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
Indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .

Such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me 
No clue

The movie turns out to be ( assayas ' ) homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
You doze off thirty minutes into the film 
A sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone 
Little visible talent and no energy 
To have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face 
Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and 
Is pretty damned funny 
Runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
Action laudable 
If only it were , well , funnier . 
The film operates nicely off the element of surprise , 
Cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix 
Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson

Conceit 
Stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and does n't pummel us with phony imagery or music 
A testament to the film 's considerable charm 
Brutally labored and unfunny hokum 
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place 
With humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived 
Though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous .

Son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if . '' 
A well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity .

In addition to hoffman 's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday .

To easy jokes and insults 
Reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama 
A fresh and absorbing look 
Of jaglom 's own profession 
It makes up for with its heart . 
Dumb 
Cliched to hardened indie-heads 
Of ` should have been a sketch on saturday night live 
Is a success in some sense 
It 's easy to love robin tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- 
Has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew 
Miss congeniality 
It 's at least watchable 
'll end up moved 
Fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution 
In his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good 
Shrek 
More confused , 
Dominated 
A low rate annie 
Insufficiently 
Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures

Wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago 
The perkiness 
A wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
It will be well worth your time . 
Immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful 
The wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material 
Enlightening , insightful and entertaining 
Like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow 
Spent elsewhere 
Please the eye 
A complex story 
Awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals 
Escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions 
Disservice 
's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span 
Celluloid garbage 
This tepid genre offering 
Nothing wrong with performances here 
Strong finish 
I 've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic ... 
Soderbergh is n't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
Delightfully against the grain 
Insultingly 
, the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady 's direction is prosaic . 
I love the robust middle of this picture . 
Hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
Disappointingly thin 
Bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
Other , better crime movies 
We ca n't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . 
Succeeded in 
Genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental 
Capture the chaos of france in the 1790 's 
It is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels 
A perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
Swallow than julie taymor 's preposterous titus 
Can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
Moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama 
Affection 
From the people laughing in the crowd 
Between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism . 
A retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness 
The intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes 
Make ` cherish ' a very good ( but not great ) movie . 
Frank capra played this story straight . 
As a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism 
Boldly stroked , luridly colored , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
A moving and important film 
Then becomes unwatchable 
Immersive 
About discovering your destination in life 
Slow scenes 
How bad his movie is 
The film 's story does not live up to its style 
Has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
It might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
Delectable 
There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
Does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country 
So bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament 
The only winner 
Gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut 
A paunchy midsection , 
` yes , that 's right : it 's forrest gump , angel of death . ' 
Of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
An uncomfortable experience , 
Almost unbearably morbid 
May really need the company of others 
A vivid , sometimes surreal , 
Grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration 
Best story 
Entirely wholesome 
The viewer wide-awake all the way through 
An unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era 
Is well done 
Needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us 
This flat run 
'll forget about it by monday , though 
The story is lacking any real emotional impact 
A third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it 
's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
Made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call ` too clever by half 
Precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen 
The movie 's rude and crude humor 
Vivid 
Beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay 
Is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema 
A perfectly rendered period piece 
Thriller as lazy 
, slow and dreary 
The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
I loved this film . 
Is funny 
To live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic 
One of a really solid woody allen film 
Faithful 
The ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense 
Soulless techno-tripe . 
In a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis 
In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
The most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any `` jackass '' fan 
`` shakes the clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance 
The magnificent swooping aerial shots 
It 's not particularly well made , but 
Is never especially clever and often 
Enough moments to keep it entertaining 
For the whole family 
Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . 
To recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness 
A genuine dramatic impact 
Deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . 
'll see a better thriller this year 
Villains 
To the concession stand and/or restroom

Wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 '' at the end of its title . 
Rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year 
Something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects 
An interesting topic , some intriguing characters 
A psychological mystery 
Most opaque , self-indulgent 
Is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
To modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance 
Loud , chaotic and 
By a strong and unforced supporting cast 
The director 's experiment is a successful one . 
The worst movie i 've seen this summer 
Hopkins 
Is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience 
Staged violence overshadows everything 
With a sweet 
Lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating 
Make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic 
The problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .

Butterfingered

Swimfan does catch on 
Randall wallace 
Of the most curiously depressing 
The film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . 
A movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why 
Incredibly irritating comedy 
And mainly unfunny 
The color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , 
It manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
The voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie 
When she should be building suspense 
Confidence

Pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
Emotionally stirring

Boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time .

Profoundly stupid affair

Assurance worthy 
Deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .

An airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
Particularly memorable effect 
Jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time 
As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
At-a-frat-party school of screenwriting

The woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring 
A poignant and wryly amusing film 
Oddly compelling . 
A disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film

Spectacle 
Have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek )

A cockeyed shot all the way . 
A movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , 
Crap 
Of the stand-up comic 
Is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh 
Manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation 
A pointed , often tender , examination 
( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) 
Discerned here that producers would be well to heed 
A glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that

Is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories

A wide summer audience 
Oscar caliber cast 
One of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theater

A sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise 
The first place 
To be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame

One feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
Grandiosity 
Is a real charmer 
Time waster ' 
Seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
Showing off 
And surehanded direction 
That it ranks with the best of herzog 's works 
A delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy 
Very capable 
One decent performance from the cast and 
Because the plot is equally hackneyed 
It can do even more damage 
's the worst movie i 've seen this summer 
Visual treat 
A coherent whole 
For true fans 
Is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario 
Makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important 
Is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- 
A suspenseful horror movie 
` hip ' 
With passion and energy 
Gay porn film 
Sameness 
Informative , 
Thrown every suspenseful clich�� in the book at this nonsensical story 
Vaguely silly overkill 
Comedy death 
Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
Ultimate scorsese film 
Eroti-comedy 
A good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . 
Beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy 
Harsh reality 
The movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
Quieter domestic scenes 
It 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich�� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( woo 's ) best work . 
Seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
A class by itself 
Its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) 
Bad sign 
Sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
Packed with moments out of an alice 
Holds you in rapt attention from 
Writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
By a talented director 
Felt with a sardonic jolt 
Funny for grown-ups as for rugrats 
Emotionally accessible , almost mystical work 
Like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema 
So intimate and 
Mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
A love story and 
The only one laughing at his own joke 
Could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
A warm , fuzzy feeling 
Is hilarious 
A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , 
The problem with antwone fisher 
, nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
The image that really tells the tale 
Could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
Stuffed to the brim with ideas 
Terrific computer graphics 
Introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
Crack you up 
Fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera 
Squanders as much as it gives out 
Butterflies that die 
Star-making 
The precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries 
I 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming 
J.k. rowling 's marvelous series 
... belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
Of a mishmash 
Goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear 
The redeeming feature of chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine . 
Creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , 
Scarily funny 
A true study , 
Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , 
A useless movie 
The tone for a summer of good stuff 
Confusion and pain 
Movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . 
Guilt-free trip 
Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- 
To a new , self-deprecating level 
Are simply too bland to be interesting . 
, the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
Has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
Revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival 
As rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely 
Of academic skullduggery and politics 
Supposedly , pokemon ca n't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over . 
Predictably conventional 
Than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating 
Ca n't really be called animation 
Mild disturbance or detached pleasure 
Without oppressive 
You ca n't miss it . 
With the clich��-laden screenplay 
'll love it and probably want to see it twice . 
Well , i 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop 
Sensual , 
Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , 
A compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation 
With the fast , funny , and even touching story 
Silly and tedious 
That is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated 
Done excellent work here 
Makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking 
Looks as if it belongs on the big screen 
A pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own 
The compassion , good-natured humor 
Of a mixed bag , with enough negatives 
Stupid americans 
, it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
Material this rich it does n't need it 
Thoughtful what-if 
, you 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions 
Adults , other than the parents ... 
The earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists 
Around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
Around this movie directionless 
You come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
Solid storytelling . 
By weaving a theme throughout this funny film 
Is one of those all-star reunions 
Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but 
's something vital about the movie . 
Not into high-tech splatterfests 
An accuracy 
Given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment 
But once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
Elizabeth hurley 's 
Makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) 
Ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you 
An ambitious movie that , like shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off 
Eloquent , reflective and beautifully 
Surprisingly gentle 
Good intentions 
A bittersweet drama 
A mesmerizing performance 
It can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again 
With an appropriate minimum of means 
It magic 
The film is well-crafted 
Mr. scorsese 's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision 
Done excellent work 
Runs out of steam after a half hour . 
Sometimes almost senseless 
Educates viewers 
Choke 
Thoughtful 
To satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood 
Of john c. walsh 's pipe dream 
Something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation 
Is utterly fearless as the tortured husband 
That already-shallow 
Hip , contemporary , in-jokey one 
Of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) 
Barely register 
Is delivered with such conviction that it 's hard not to be carried away 
Sturdiest example yet 
Deeply meditative 
Have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
Soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , 
Estela bravo 's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro 
A ` girls gone wild ' video 
's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor 
Hilarious kenneth branagh 
Madonna 's cameo does n't suck ! 
Tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke 
A love story as sanguine 
Beating the austin powers films 
The determination of pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop 
Tiresome love triangles 
It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ... 
Told with sharp ears and eyes 
Indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
Gesturing 
Continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
A story worth caring about 
Uncomfortable 
Something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
Captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , 
Be as bored 
( davis ) wants to cause his audience an epiphany 
Biographical fantasia 
Because of its epic scope 
That rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep 
Not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved 
Look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful 
Such a great one 
, you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
And not in a good way 
A side dish no one ordered 
With its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner 
Is to be cherished 
Structured and well-realized 
Charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark 
About female friendship that men can embrace and women 
A quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job 
Certainly hard to hate 
'll feel as the credits roll 
Is like scorsese 's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot 
Gorgeous and finely detailed 
Zings along with vibrance and warmth 
Playfully profound 
, you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
, this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman 's warmest . 
As exciting to watch as two last-place basketball 
The distance 
Inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc 
Without intent 
An action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
Forced drama in this wildly uneven movie 
Sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
We can enjoy as mild escapism 
Irreparable 
Detention 
Is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad 
Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
The imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless 
Leaves something to be desired 
B-movie scum 
Honest 
Most generic 
That is , more often then not , difficult and sad 
Generous and 
Is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
's coherent , well shot , and 
Camera movements 
Absurd plot twists , 
Waters 
Schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
This stuck pig of a movie 
Otherwise comic 
( while the last metro ) was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
Rejected x-files episode 
It can be a bit repetitive 
It suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
Looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man 
That you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
As darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle 
Is to frighten and disturb 
Especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
Left a few crucial things out , 
Sirk 
May well be the only one laughing at his own joke 
Littered with celluloid garbage 
Covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , 
Which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking 
The dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
A delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
Of interest 
A formula comedy 
, giggly little story 
Lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
A children 's film in the truest sense 
The merits of fighting hard for something that really matters 
Rotting 
This remake of lina wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john 
Glizty 
's as good as you remember 
Is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
Dreary 
You ca n't wait to see end . 
The story itself is actually quite vapid . 
Brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
An irresistibly uncanny ambience 
Your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute 
Successful at lodging itself in the brain 
Until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy 
Reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others 
Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich�� . 
Like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . 
Bisset is both convincing and radiant 
An enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we 've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar . 
Everybody else is in the background 
Nothing but boilerplate clich��s 
Enter 
Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
Breathes life 
Stylish psychological thriller 
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and 
Moved to the edge of their seats 
Is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles 
High production values 
Particularly nightmarish 
And utterly pointless 
Quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar 
Gifted artists 
Forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
Sacrificing the integrity of the opera 
Ultimately very satisfying 
About this latest reincarnation of the world 's greatest teacher 
Of sharp writing 
A welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front 
Mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis 
Is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight 
The soullessness 
Blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) 
Real stars 
The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
Carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders 
As obvious as telling a country skunk 
Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm 
Have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh 's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination 
Gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic 
, i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
Stimulating and demanding 
Bright and 
A good surprise ending 
A strong first act 
It 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance 
And it 's what makes their project so interesting 
One oscar nomination 
But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail . 
The atmosphere of the crime expertly 
Most poorly staged and 
And unrelentingly exploitative 
Director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel . 
The enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild 
There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
Nicely 
Like a book report 
Slog 
So intimate and sensual and funny 
Significantly different ( and better ) 
Shrill , simple and soapy . 
Real star 
Dead 
An impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame 
, discontent , and yearning 
Has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so 
A catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america ... 
Small gem 
Despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz 
... gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life 's ultimate losers . 
An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay 
Many conclusive answers in the film 
Comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
It 's stylishly directed with verve ... 
Is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style . 
A boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- 
Have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject . 
Sustain interest 
Auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . 
The movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
Is a movie that understands characters must come first 
A series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
Hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to 
Creepiest conventions 
Derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting 
It does n't work . 
A family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation 
Both sides of this emotional car-wreck 
Is emerging in world cinema 
While it may not add up to the sum of its parts 
For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
Stupid and 
To the point of nausea 
Should stick to his day job 
Not that funny 
As a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix 
, well , 
Diva 
Represents an engaging and intimate first feature 
Delicately crafted film 
An uplifting , near-masterpiece 
Mordantly funny 
A well-crafted film 
Anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year 
Whip-smart 
Seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . 
Characteristically engorged and sloppy 
Jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience 
Raunch 
For the most part , the film does hold up pretty well . 
The finished product 's unshapely look 
To sustain a good simmer for most of its running time 
Entertains 
Cruelly funny 
Chore 
Lobotomy 
The dream world of teen life 
This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , 
Truly excellent sequences 
It 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain 
A bad day 
Without any redeeming value whatsoever 
Of describing badness 
There 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that 's part of what makes dover kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent 
Funniness 
In your heart 
Letting you share her one-room world for a while 
Deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 
` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore 
It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them 
Exercise in formula crash-and-bash action 
Otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , 
Toilet 
, sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . 
Standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth 
A bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert 
Tendentious 
To be cherished 
Despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema 
Second , what 's with all the shooting ? 
Unimpeachable 
Stitched together from stock situations and characters 
's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
May be burns 's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen 
Perfect performance 
A james bond series for kids 
's got as potent a topic as ever here 
Would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes 
Satisfyingly 
That it does afford 
The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film 
Turbulent self-discovery 
Trotting out threadbare standbys 
Does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation 
Lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies 
This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it 
But also intriguing and honorable , 
Really need a remake of `` charade 
In laramie following the murder of matthew shepard 
's much to recommend the film 
Rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
As inept 
Unassuming , subordinate 
A lovely film ... elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic ... hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source 's complexity . 
An artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
Hossein 
Beautifully shot 
Is wonderful 
Sentimental ooze 
Primitive animated special effects 
No explanation or even 
An irresistible blend of warmth and humor 
As the mediterranean sparkles 
With its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises 
Truly wonderful 
Strong-minded 
Into some univac-like script machine 
Cold 
Is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially 
Feel good 
An effective portrait of a life in stasis -- 
Only pain 
Somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard 
After a while , hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
Insulting 
A temporal inquiry 
How tedious 
A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
Sufficient 
Adrenaline boost 
Is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
Of happy 
The great minds of our times 
Mr. polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
Gives a superb performance 
Deny its seriousness and quality 
Cold-hearted curmudgeon 
Feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope 
: land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place . 
Heartwarming 
The pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze . 
Like the hanks character , he 's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
Is scott 's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
Watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy . 
A particularly nightmarish fairytale 
Something more beautiful than either of those films 
Taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) 
Moving and stark reminder 
Do n't really care too much about this love story . 
Comedy and melodrama 
By turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy 
Its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting 
Miscalculates badly 
Is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness 
Numbing experience 
He respects the material without sentimentalizing it 
A hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant 's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones 's diary . 
Of no erotic or sensuous charge 
Throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , 
Of shape 
Is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes 
Many flaws 
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : 
Young romantics 
Is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit 
Ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold 
By a set of heartfelt performances 
Insurance 
Striking villains 
Does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
Much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
Better 
It 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
, you 're in luck . 
Full of cheesy dialogue 
Can usually be traced back to the little things 
As clever 
If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor 
Between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking 
The movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
It 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 
Is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
An almost constant mindset of suspense 
Are so old-fashioned 
Of admission for the ridicule factor 
Skillfully 
Flaws , but also 
That examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling 
One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
There would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
The secret 's eventual discovery 
Easier to sit through than most of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films 
Gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . 
Holds promise , 
Comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . 
Unwieldy cast 
The horror fan 
Ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour 
Is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker 
A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
To reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon 
Is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype 
Career-defining revelation 
With bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary 
A british cast 
The bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time 
Just so the documentary will be over 
Enjoyable choice 
Required genuine acting from ms. spears 
Knows how to make our imagination wonder . 
Cold , sterile and lacking 
Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
Congrats disney on a job well done 
Take you places you have n't been , and also places you have 
Is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
The film above anything sandler 
Proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent 
Pale imitation 
( russell ) makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
Cheapening it 
It would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head 
There must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
A terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome 
A bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling 
Uniquely sensual 
When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
Of all those famous moments 
The rollicking dark humor so necessary 
Does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
The characters are paper thin and 
Slapping its target audience in the face 
Nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it 
Clever ideas and 
We 've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there 's an enthusiastic charm in fire that makes the formula fresh again 
Gripping drama . 
A man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character 
An audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes 
, you 'll cheer . 
A stylish exercise in revisionism whose point 
A cheap thriller 
A sensitive , moving 
Penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
The logic 
Worth catching 
's not like having a real film of nijinsky 
An oddly winning portrayal of one 
Just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception 
A stale , overused cocktail 
Who might enjoy this 
Romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy 
His wife look so bad in a major movie 
That pollyana would reach for a barf bag 
With their fathers 
A huge disappointment coming , 
Ruined by amateurish writing and acting 
There 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose . 
An insane comic undertaking 
About the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it 
One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . 
Fast and funny 
Unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs 
Likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
The surprisingly shoddy makeup work 
This arrogant richard pryor wannabe 
One of the worst films of the summer 
It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie . 
Is masterful 
Has little wit and no surprises . 
Sublimely lofty 
'' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` tonight . '' 
( and educational ) 
20 years apart 
Rates as an exceptional thriller . 
`` frailty '' starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme . 
And it is n't that funny . 
It 'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
( a ) soulless 
, i 'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
Offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame 
Is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
That clever angle 
A fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic 
Star 
An affectionate 
For its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway 
You do n't want to think too much about what 's going on 
Nothing in it to engage children emotionally 
Than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises 
, so it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
Is nicely shot , well-edited 
Discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman 
Fret 
Fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire 
As decent drama/action flick 
With impressive results 
Takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
As naturally charming as it needs to be 
Is dazzling 
Ultimate 
Touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon 
Simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny 
Piano 
Have a whale of a good time . 
Quickly wears out its limited welcome 
Rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel 
These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently 
Mixed-up films 
That feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years 
Implicitly 
Exciting and well-paced . 
Is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
Quietly moving 
Succeeds in entertaining 
My eyelids ... getting 
You 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch 
A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 
Rejected 
Is painterly 
's a very tasteful rock and roll movie 
Squirming in their seats 
Well done 
On its own , it 's not very interesting . 
Is a horrible movie -- 
I could not stand them 
Ver wiel 's 
The ` ick ' 
Serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , 
Leaves you giddy 
Talent 
In a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
About tattoos 
There is nothing in it to engage children emotionally 
Care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
In 1958 brooklyn 
Of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of 
The passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- 
A consummate actor 
Bad mannered , ugly and destructive little **** 
's superficial and unrealized 
Intimate and socially encompassing 
Banged their brains 
Are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief 
Giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . 
To have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s the filmmakers could dredge up 
Of surprises 
, dramatically satisfying heroine 
Ghetto 
The gags are puerile . 
A film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
Delight 
Master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
Hopkins/rock collision 
This is n't worth sitting through 
Why human beings long for what they do n't have 
Strangely impersonal and abstract 
A video helmer 
Happens that tells you there is no sense 
Might not seem like the proper cup of tea 
The movie is certainly easy to watch . 
Try to surprise us with plot twists

Crudup 's anchoring performance 
A rehash 
To a biting satire that has no teeth 
Comes out looking like something wholly original 
Unremittingly ugly 
Beautifully crafted 
Enjoys 
Every turn of elizabeth berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm 
That could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker 
Decidedly unoriginal 
The words `` radical '' or `` suck '' 
Hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
's mostly a pleasure to watch . 
His greatest triumph 
How much they engage and even touch us 
This strenuously unconventional movie 
The exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) 
A frustrating ` tweener ' 
As important as humor 
Enthrall 
, though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
Very very strong `` b + 
Dramatized 
The year 's greatest adventure , and jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate 
Under the skin of her characters 
Fresh view 
The movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
Right ways

With no aspirations 
Operatic 
Tender hug 
Beautiful stars 
Unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two 
Another shameless attempt 
Despite bearing the paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement european pickup . 
Over-blown 
Nicolas cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and 
A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much 
Maudlin ending

Well made 
Succeeds through sincerity 
Warmth and humor 
Failed jokes , twitchy acting , 
The most complex , generous and subversive artworks 
An ungainly movie 
Sadistic bike flick 
The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and 
A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set 
Built for controversy . 
In a sick , twisted sort of way 
Great combination act 
Is duly impressive in imax dimensions , 
With cloying messages and irksome characters 
Pleasing way 
All awkward 
Has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past . 
Skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd 
Star script 
Terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
The film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original 
's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before 
, hard-hitting documentary . 
Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess . 
Ingenious and often 
Merely pretentious -- 
Has a pleasing way with a metaphor . 
Went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood 
Ladles on the local flavor with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza 
A glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
Delightful stimulus

Co-stars 
To stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny 
Intricate , intimate and intelligent journey 
Lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair 
Modest , straight-ahead standards 
In modern alienation 
A sense of childhood imagination 
Leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama 
Tear-stained 
Falling 
Innocent and 
With weak dialogue and biopic 
Her welcome in her most charmless performance 
One terrific story with lots of laughs 
Stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters 
Looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad 
More grueling and 
That 's neither original nor terribly funny 
Transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories . 
Give a backbone to the company 
The film is like sitting in a downtown caf�� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
Superior '' 
A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece 
Old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale 
Its rather slow beginning 
Serious and thoughtful . 
Is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces 
But here 's a movie about it anyway . 
A time machine , a journey back to your childhood , 
The difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
Were made for the palm screen 
The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but 
Sits in the place where a masterpiece should be 
Enough vices to merit its 103-minute length 
A really solid woody allen film 
Leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
Always looks good 
Preposterousness 
Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
Out of character and logically porous action set 
Low-budget and tired 
Muddled drama 
's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory 
Unusually tame 
Markedly inactive 
That keeps you guessing at almost every turn 
The possible exception of elizabeth hurley 's breasts 
All movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
One of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theater . 
This forgettable effort 
To even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure 
Weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
About the plight of american indians in modern america 
Historically significant 
Wrong on both counts 
Noble failure . 
Overused 
A bland animated sequel that 
No sense of pride or shame 
Insultingly unbelievable final act 
A visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects . 
Paint-by-numbers picture 
Of pure misogynist evil 
The production is suitably elegant 
That frenetic spectacle ( on the tv show ) 
Huge action sequence 
Is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious 
The hardy spirit 
A chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
The emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` mulan '' or `` tarzan 
The broiling sun 
Inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo 
For drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
, the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
Sloppy slapstick 
He 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
Adventure story and history lesson

Too full 
Comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on showtime 's ` red shoe diaries 
Well-crafted psychological study 
Girls ca n't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it 's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
Virtually impossible 
Devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects .

Schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie 
All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling . 
Fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer 
In luck 
Soderbergh 's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
The story is bogus 
If it were n't such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play 
A deftly entertaining film 
Charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . 
Such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care 
The most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still 
For kids or their parents 
Has plenty of laughs . 
Enjoyably over-the-top 
... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels . 
Occasionally inspired dialogue bits

Remarkable and memorable 
Spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . 
Everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for 
Quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite

A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably 
With maggots crawling on a dead dog 
The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- 
A powerful look 
Strip it of all its excess debris , and you 'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie .

A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy 
Female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael 
Just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - broadway play 
So-called ` comedy '

Since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .

For following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish

Smart , not cloying 
Huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
An earnest , roughshod document 
Imaginative filmmaking 
The film 's hero is a bore and 
Cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
Maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor .

Returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
The soulful gravity 
Lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject -- taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history . 
Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
A dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation 
Surprisingly decent flick 
Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner 
Rigid 
Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling . 
Fresh , sometimes funny , and 
Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its ��lan , humor , bile , and irony .

It 's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer 
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't . 
This exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen

Kidman has become one of our best actors 
Trite and overused 
A lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition 
Her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
In which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense 
You 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing 
To be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering 
A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .

Early laughs 
Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .

Demented in a good way 
Witty ,

Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
Comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .

Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .

A touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
A little too much resonance with real world events 
Choppy , overlong documentary about ` the lifestyle . '

His latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form 
A real howler 
Funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic . 
Well together

Nothing to gain from watching they 
To elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires

A man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone 
Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . 
Even if the ring has a familiar ring , it 's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror . 
There 's no fizz 
Your favorite pet get buried alive 
Old-fashioned values 
It 's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage .

The ring never lets you off the hook . 
Overweight and out 
Looking for something new

Succeed in alienating most viewers 
A smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture 
A movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made . 
Much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 
Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
As happy listening to movies 
That 's the mark of a documentary that works 
Troubling and 
Disgusting 
That it is n't very good 
Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
That just seem like a bad idea from frame one

A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions 
The ensemble cast 
A severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness 
Friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , 
Is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects

By an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing 
Fit chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special 
With indoctrinated prejudice 
Well wrought 
Wanting more answers as the credits 
Funny little movie 
The limited chemistry

Ultra-violent gangster wannabe 
Plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy . 
Watch the movie 
It 's inauthentic at its core 
Bad writing 
Proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .

Polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions 
You swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises

Cheap 
A thinking man 's monster movie 
A moratorium , effective immediately , 
Concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt 
Boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery 
It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , 
Thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy

Bad romances 
Leigh makes these lives count . 
His impressions of life and loss and 
As good , 
Is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
In a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances 
A feel-good movie can still show real heart 
Like one of ( spears ' ) music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .

Heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv 
Is forgettable 
The trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ... because you get it . 
The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil 
Is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
Uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor

This colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon 
Be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) 
Practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor 
The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
Kicks into gear 
Begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
Were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned 
Not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department 
Danish cows

Marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula . 
As enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant 's two best films 
New kind 
S1m0ne 's satire is not subtle ,

Co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard 
A huge box-office 
Good and different 
I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great ... i 'm not , and then i realized that i just did n't care . 
Polished , well-structured film 
There are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction 
Ecstasy 
The charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers . 
Is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love 
The brilliant performances by testud 
Nonsensical story 
's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . 
's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins . 
Because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue 
By no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
And pretentious endeavor 
A personal low 
God help us 
Face arrest 15 years after their crime 
I still want my money back . 
And more entertaining , too 
Is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
Never fails to fascinate . 
All comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . 
Inventive cinematic tricks and 
The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
Suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers . 
That pours into every frame 
Cultural satire 
Enveloping affection 
's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet ? '' 
This is n't exactly profound cinema , 
Puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible 
That the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice 
The mess 
's mildly sentimental 
Is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
Maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards 
Uniquely itself 
Narrative banality 
Uncommonly ambitious 
Just does n't figure in the present hollywood program . 
Sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent 
Is n't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? 
You 'll have a good time with this one too

The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen . 
Very much like life 
In this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . ' 
Hollywood ending just is n't very funny . 
A corny examination 
Ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities 
Winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars 
That this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history 
Emotional blandness 
A feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate 
An intimate feeling , 
An honored screen veteran 
Some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat 
Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
Does n't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience 
Frustrated and detached 
A sweet-tempered comedy 
A fine documentary 
Jacquot preserves tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
Arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone 
It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , 
Intricately structured and well-realized drama 
So impersonal or 
Proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
Might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about 
Is clearly a good thing . 
Thrill you , touch you and make you 
Written so well , 
Undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads 
I found myself howling more than cringing 
Stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
The best he 's been in years 
Speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand 
The overall fabric is hypnotic , 
Complete moron 
You may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
Great deal 
It 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny 
Smile 
The movie is like scorsese 's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for 
His characters are acting horribly 
Is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that 
Naturalistic 
Larry fessenden 's spooky new thriller

Shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them 
Constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , 
Would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture 
Psychologically savvy . 
White oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that does n't mean you wo n't like looking at it 
After an uncertain start 
No major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle 
Dramatic impact 
The film is way too full of itself 
However entertainingly presented , 
Illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box 
Poignant and funny . 
A rumor of angels does n't just slip -- 
-- and disposable story 
... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .

One of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years .

Handled correctly , wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .

Wretched 
In an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters 
Ame and unnecessary 
Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and 
For the perspective it offers 
Even less surprises 
Compelling historical tale 
Venturesome 
It certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
In producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad 
Unfocused screenplay 
For all its social and political potential , state property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
Rollerball left us cold 
Vibrant , and intelligent 
If you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
So sloppy , 
Wall-to-wall good time

Raucously amusing 
Marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today 
Seems manufactured to me and artificial 
Is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil 
As sexy 
Dreary mess 
Fun , curiously adolescent movie 
It 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
Your pooper-scoopers 
... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . ' 
While this film has an ` a ' list cast and some strong supporting players 
Comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
The plight 
Gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , 
Addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat 
Most pitiful directing 
Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue 
A terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian 
Despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development 
It employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities 
: it 's not scary in the slightest . 
What 's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller 
Is both gripping and compelling 
That 's right 
Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
The saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world 
Though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . 
Leaving you with some laughs and a smile 
Timeless and unique perspective 
It is very difficult to care about the character 
It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action . 
That you 'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment 
Neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . 
To a small star with big heart 
Seen in that light 
Shrewd enough 
Less compelling than the circumstances of its making

It 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems 
The funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 
Does n't try to surprise us with plot twists 
Funnier version of the old police academy flicks 
`` bad '' is the operative word for `` bad company , '' and i do n't mean that in a good way . 
A very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then 
Puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting .

Surprisingly idealistic 
Is a tribute to shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
Honest working man john q. archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher

Michael moore 's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the ` are we a sick society ? ' 
Tepid genre offering 
Its mean-spirited second half 
No better or worse than ` truth or consequences , n.m. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia 
Is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
There 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back 
Apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
The film is one of the year 's best .

Astonishingly condescending 
Screwing

Experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads 
The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative . 
Preachy-keen 
Intriguing twist

Utterly incompetent 
The gabbiest giant-screen movie 
Bloodbath 
Incoherence and redundancy 
From philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron 
Raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings . 
Gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo

Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout

A clich�� left 
It does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen 
The dreary expanse of dead-end distaste 
Draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them 
Berling and b��art ... continue to impress , and isabelle huppert ... again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters 
The film settles too easily along the contours of expectation 
Henry bean 's thoughtful screenplay 
You realize there 's no place for this story to go but down 
Brainless

Scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances 
It 's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless 
A movie-industry satire 
Call this film a lump of coal 
, biting and witty feature 
Inconsistent 
Honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
It sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
Matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
Mamet 's airless cinematic shell games . 
Aimless 
Constant smiles and 
Of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story 
The saccharine sentimentality 
A whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
Creative team 
Covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u.s. 
Put through torture 
Growing strain 
Of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes 
The production has been made with an enormous amount of affection 
Terrific flair 
Of bad animation and mindless violence 
The young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive 
Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion 
Will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
When it 's this rich and luscious 
Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . 
Spiritual film taps 
To burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
Is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
Lamer 
Of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm 
Atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad 
Evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks 
That is all the more remarkable because it 
A fudged opportunity 
This laughable dialogue 
Go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year 
This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
Our infantilized culture 
How a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head 
A detailed historical document ,

Even the bull gets recycled . 
Same sledgehammer appeal 
Reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy 
Displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard 
Writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew 
Gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing 
Carvey 's ) characters are both overplayed and exaggerated 
Perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d 
A cinematic corpse

Clueless 
May puzzle his most ardent fans . 
, the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
Exhaustingly

Fail to crack a smile at

Grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments

Of their first full flush of testosterone 
The strange horror of life 
Winning comedy 
Nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming 
By drawing me into the picture 
It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
Has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches 
Political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country 
Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clich��s . 
Aimless , arduous , and 
Yet overflows with wisdom and emotion .

The answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
Otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists

They are having so much fun 
Superb production values & christian bale 's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
One of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
It 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
It begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject 
Unlike trey parker , sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
Is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned . 
Its audience giddy with the delight of discovery 
Has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable . 
To make a big splash 
Is that its own action is n't very effective 
The sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack 
Do n't even bother to rent this on video

Charming and

Smarter than your average bond 
Look too deep into the story 
The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
A live-wire film that

Creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , 
Elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires

The filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
Felt trapped and with no obvious escape 
Technical skill and rare depth 
Of virtuosic set pieces 
The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , 
A work of enthralling drama 
Always brooding

If you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you 
The wake of saving private ryan 
That skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front 
A loquacious and dreary piece 
Once she lets her love depraved leads meet , ( denis ' ) story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle 
Just fell apart 
It does n't leave you with much . 
Takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
Great monster/science fiction flicks 
Perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , 
Gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching 
Is a very good viewing alternative for young women 
Better hip-hop clips 
A host of splendid performances 
Being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances 
Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .

Absurd finale

It does n't even seem like she tried . 
That was n't all that great to begin with 
Notorious c.h.o. still feels like a promising work-in-progress 
Are clinically depressed 
A case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications 
Emotional evolution 
A little uneven to be the cat 's meow ,

A fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman .

Transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals 
There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... 
Much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives 
By the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen 
A movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still 
Beautifully read and 
A convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination 
Of romantic obsession 
A jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clich�� of japanese animation 
Of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph 
Going to love the piano teacher 
Is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound 
Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
Spiked with raw urban humor 
Is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects 
Pleasingly upbeat 
Sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest 
A thoughtful examination of faith , love and power 
Its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

Complicated characters 
Smoothly 
To catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them 
Most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i 
Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
A subtle , humorous , illuminating study

Hooting 
Appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich��s the filmmakers could dredge up 
Changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it 's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say 
Like a 10-course banquet 
It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good . 
Has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation

By the time it 's done with us , mira nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over 
Actor raymond j. barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
Is stiff or just plain bad 
It 's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
I 've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .

The beast should definitely get top billing

The chatter of parrots raised on oprah

Its leaden acting , 
Have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching .

Will leave you thinking 
Sanctimonious , self-righteous

Encouraging thought 
Highly uneven and inconsistent ... margarita happy hour kinda 
Stock clich��s 
Its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and 
Are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense 
Badly-rendered cgi effects 
The actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans 
That cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma 
A powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt 
Will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face . 
Eloquent ( meditation ) on death 
That deals with first love sweetly 
A 75-minute sample of puerile

There may have been a good film in `` trouble every day , '' but it is not what is on the screen . 
It surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion

Much stranger than any fiction

In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
A captivating and intimate study 
What i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what 's unique and quirky about canadians 
... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . 
More than its fair share of saucy hilarity . 
A tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and 
Allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title 
To a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with 
Never reach satisfying conclusions 
Who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground

Gorgeous film 
We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` chris rock , ' ` anthony hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some univac-like script machine . 
The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .

This is not a jackie chan movie . 
Nothing new 
More than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway 
Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
Her fans walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost . 
Sinuously plotted 
The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , 
The script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .

Is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
Lackadaisical plotting and mindless action 
A decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen 
Much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
Uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .

Boxes these women 's souls right open for us 
Hindered 
It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy 
Zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that 's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but 
Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience 
Strangely sinister happy ending 
The endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing 
The dead horse of surprise 
Wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion 
Adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special 
Real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros .

The intoxicating fumes and 
It 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . 
Tragedy 
Whether or not you buy mr. broomfield 's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr. broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover . 
Turn down 
Zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and 
He does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
Really special walk 
A quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music 
Documentarian 
A time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , 
The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
Trust an audience 's intelligence 
Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but 
Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier 
Excites the imagination and 
Is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects 
Trying to laugh at how bad

Runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . 
Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .

Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
Of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation 
All things we 've seen before 
Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously 
Overlong soap 
Gorgeous , passionate 
The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit 
It entertaining 
The raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness 
Falls down 
, old-fashioned-movie movie 
Spiteful 
Finely tuned 
A boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for 
Trashy , kinky fun 
See : terrorists are more evil than ever ! 
It 's so not-at-all-good 
Wicked black comedy 
Star trek was kind of terrific once , 
Translate well to the screen 
Directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
Allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being

What makes the film special 
The charms of the lead performances 
Nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
Waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .

Transparently 
Majidi 's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
Compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph .

The most practiced curmudgeon 
( a ) painfully flat gross-out comedy ...

Sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one 
Politically potent 
It 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
Does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely 
Delivers more goodies than lumps of coal 
Emphasizes the well-wrought story and 
Marked an emerging indian american cinema 
Lacks 
Gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
Family , forgiveness and love 
Labored 
Touching , 
Even through its flaws , revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling 
Sucked dry the undead action flick formula 
My wife is an actress works as well as it does because ( the leads ) are such a companionable couple . 
More measured or polished production 
Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
That ca n't totally hide its contrivances 
Super-simple animation 
Tosca 's intoxicating ardor 
Next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
A verbal duel 
And cinematic deception 
Of being a bit undisciplined 
Point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover 
Wildly overproduced 
Note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget 
In undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs 
The pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
Is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre 
As rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac 
A good line in charm 
Such a companionable couple 
Relentlessly nasty 
95 minutes 
Quirkily appealing 
Elegant and sly deadpan 
` gentle ' 
Will find millions of eager fans 
May be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
Quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
Is an uncompromising film 
Is like reading a research paper , 
Offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
Strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain 
Why , for instance , good things happen to bad people 
Despicable 
Open windows 
Value can not be denied 
Represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch 
Well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
Overly long 
Would subtlety be lost on the target audience 
A gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good 
Smart , compelling 
This is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout 
Is nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear 
World traveler gave me no reason to care 
Proves to be a compelling 
Felt ; not the craven of ' a nightmare on elm street ' or ` the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` deadly friend 
Terrific screenplay 
What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
More ambitious 
Seems worth the effort 
It does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
May be convinced that he has something significant to say 
To be both hugely entertaining and uplifting . 
, boredom never takes hold . 
Left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose 
Exhilarating 
Formula mercilessly 
Great story 
Is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
Of faith in the future 
Movie gauge 
Gloriously 
Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
Providing comic relief 
Gentle and engrossing character 
Whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man 
This is n't a movie ; 
Does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
An undeniable entertainment value 
Invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games 
Is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
About something is an amicable endeavor . 
An excellent sequel . 
Funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic 
Impressively discreet filmmakers 
's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon 
The production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 
Provides 
Insight and humor 
Has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ... 
Achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation 
This film 's impressive performances and 
Futile concoction 
Begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot . 
The slapstick is labored , and 
Infantile 
Raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up 
Even a plot 
Avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash 
Feel realistic 
Weirdness for the sake of weirdness 
Unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor 
What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
Sags 
We do n't even like their characters . 
Interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot 
Could n't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions 
Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , 
Is ) a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie 
The most ravaging , 
It wo n't hold up over the long haul 
Have at it 
Seamless 
Of boring talking heads , etc . 
Re-invents himself 
A predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point 
Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often 
The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
Its sincere acting 
This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head 
Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but 
An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that 
Balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner 
Does n't even seem like she tried 
The attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way . 
The impressive stagings of hardware 
That even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel 
His sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad 
It 's just grating 
Stimulating 
Sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
Did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting 
Unusual but unfortunately also irritating 
Two hours better watching 
Tiresome rant 
Is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . 
Such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play 
Creative act 
Hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation 
Check this one out 
Sparkling 
Are based on stock clich��s 
Never so vividly 
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
Stand-up magic 
A solid , psychological action film from hong kong 
The `` saving private ryan '' battle scenes 
Create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch 
Goose-pimple 
To see what all the fuss is about 
, the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
Some savvy street activism 
That 's still too burdened by the actor 
, she 's appealingly manic and energetic . 
Urge to doze 
Also nicely done 
A pretty decent little documentary 
Temperamental 
Is dark , brooding and slow , 
Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
An intricate plot 
Much of jonah simply , and gratefully 
Humor and technological finish 
So lovely toward the end 
All mood and no movie . 
Give it a boost 
If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you 
Fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
Is one of the year 's best films . 
Who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
Stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim 
Entirely humorless 
Has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` baran . 
Intellectual and 
Engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2 
Bloated effects 
Its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm 
Made a point or two regarding life 
By anything on display 
Is entirely appealing as pumpkin 
A compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
This odd , poetic road movie , 
Also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
Sets the tone for a summer of good stuff 
With yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective 
Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
Try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored 
At the end that extravagantly redeems it 
Makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and 
Snagged an oscar nomination 
To embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 
Decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him 
Par with the first one 
Coos beseechingly at you 
The hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
Approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson 's far side humor 
Marred 
The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
Fringe feminist conspiracy theorist 
, meandering , and sometimes dry 
Few good ideas 
A hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched 
Inspiring , ironic , and 
Is astonishing . 
, bile , and irony 
Have put together a bold biographical fantasia 
Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
's cliche to call the film ` refreshing 
Weak 
Of the best , most 
The knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies 
Misleading 
Made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate 
Is ) the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein 
The lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse 
Is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way 
New age 
Intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary 
, it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . 
Squirming 
A great piece 
Is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
Why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
Quirky , charming 
The good , which is its essential problem 
Forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense 
Is a beautiful film to watch 
Noyce 's greatest mistake 
Feel-good family comedy 
You love the music , and i do 
A monster 
Ensures 
A level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated 
A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people 
Are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject 
Is particularly impressive 
Has enough moments to keep it entertaining 
From an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground 
Stylish exercise 
Is a must for genre fans 
Enthusiastic 
Timelessness 
That you feel what they feel 
Worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia 
Nightmarish 
A bit melodramatic and even a little dated 
Wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles 
The charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock 
Barbershop is tuned in to its community . 
Owed to benigni 
Rated eee for excitement 
Its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals 
Muddy sound 
Manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time 
As compelling

Predictable at every turn 
Volatile 
Comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won

The longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life 
Dead ( water ) weight

Kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk 
Attractive throughout 
Would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
The rarest kinds of films 
Listen to extremist name-calling 
, painful improbability 
Accomplishes 
Are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack 
Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich�� of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms. paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
That 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast 
Strong itch to explore more 
Perpetually wasted 
An intense experience 
Feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
That plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither 
, so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
A must-see 
Make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again 
Breaks your heart 
Ick ' 
Very original 
As giddy and whimsical and relevant today 
There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling 
So hilarious 
An undeniably moving film 
Compelling , amusing and unsettling 
The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
Not easily and , in the end , not well enough 
A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man 
That will enthrall the whole family 
Awful 
Stereotypical familial quandaries 
In a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- 
Enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins 
Supporting 
Excite 
Both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . 
Of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates 
To find better entertainment 
The energetic and always surprising performance 
Brady 
Good laughs 
Aloof and 
Is careless and unfocused 
's brilliant ` videodrome 
To do , too little time to do it in 
A pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie 
With revulsion 
The film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
Enough to feel good about 
Anti-feminist 
That has something to say 
Enjoy as mild escapism 
Tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , and 
Dull . 
Is to be mesmerised 
It is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
May not 
Imitations 
Tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
Great performances , 
`` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time 
The slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise 
Jim carrey 
Furiously funny pace 
It does n't make for great cinema , 
Dare i say , entertaining 
Scoob and shag do n't eat enough during the film . ' 
Takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and 
Feel ` stoked 
Final whistle 
Do n't think this movie loves women at all 
Through the horrible pains of a death 
Work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns 
But film buffs should get to know 
A journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist 
It 's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
Can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something 
Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage . 
Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
Those farts got to my inner nine-year-old 
It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
Messenger 
Illogic 
Starts slowly , but adrien brody -- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
The pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion 
This all works out 
Shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
Festival 
, dumb action movie 
Some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh 
Holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot 
It 's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun 
Magical enough 
Is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
An exquisite , unfakable sense 
Fresh and raw like a blown-out vein 
A little wit 
Sleek 
Unmemorable filler . 
To being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be 
Just do n't really care too much about this love story . 
Bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . 
An exceptional thriller 
With all its botches 
A good ear for dialogue , 
's the gift of the magi relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc 's drug scene . 
Is predictable 
Who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- 
Mawkish dialogue 
It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
Cellophane-pop remake 
Runs for only 71 minutes and 
Every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . 
The surface histrionics 
, the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
There 's nothing to gain from watching they . 
A pleasing way 
For veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . 
The only reason 
Have to check your brain at the door 
Damned wonderful 
Resentment 
Beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm 
If you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here 's a fun one . 
Hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread 
Promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili 
As exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams 
Blond honeys 
Schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy 
'll enjoy this movie 
Combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . 
, is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
A taste for the quirky 
Extraordinary debut 
A life-affirming message 
In the long-winded heist comedy 
Mean it 's good enough for our girls 
A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music 
... while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare 's macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
Ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies 
Roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph 
A two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
Stranded 
Old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one 
The rare imax movie that you 'll wish 
You 're more likely to enjoy on a computer 
Unromantic 
Acted and directed , it 's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
Felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world 
Inspiring , ironic , 
Their children 
Earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 
Most impressive 
Labyrinthine 
This is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby 
Overstated 
Little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and 
That puts another notch 
These things 
Powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
Trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed 
Success

This mess 
Why it works 
Disappointed by a movie in a long time 
Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
Fun or energy 
Offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film 
Undeniably moving film 
Was more diverting and thought-provoking 
That this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does n't have big screen magic 
Layer of action man clich�� atop wooden dialogue 
A fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick 
Watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 
Consistently sensitive and often exciting 
Enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story 
Articulates a flood of emotion . 
Is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film 
Too much exploitation and too little 
God help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves 
His several silly subplots 
Intelligent and deeply 
With adventure and a worthwhile environmental message 
Meandering 
Nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot 
Bring on the battle bots , please 
Imperfect ? 
Attracts the young and fit 
Kid-empowerment fantasy 
Appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and 
Lazily and glumly 
Shot on digital videotape rather than film 
Odd drama 
Inside the mess that is world traveler 
Brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , 
Sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 
The grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking 
It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
The cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
Takes the most unexpected material 
Sly humor 
Leftovers 
Even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ... 
Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable 
The story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic 
Stomach-knotting suspense 
What sets ms. birot 's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
Her fearlessness 
An eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , ` spy kids 2 ' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
Is sorely lacking 
New or interesting 
Address his own world war ii experience in his signature style 
Go from stark desert 
Confront it 
's something i would rather live in denial about 
The film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .

Stress ` dumb . 
Suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected 
Of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live

Still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival 
Crass , contrived sequels 
Fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere . 
Emotionally at least ) 
Are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
Eye-catching 
Overwhelming waste 
The world 's most fascinating stories 
Eloquently 
A cult favorite 
Rather special 
Good race 
Amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l.a. 's show-biz and media 
Enough laughs to sustain interest to the end 
( fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall ) show us the world they love and make 
Methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain . 
Really bad 
Pitifully unromantic 
Loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money 
Wishy-washy 
Carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . 
Of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups 
Darkly funny and frequently insightful 
Essential 
, kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
Jeong-hyang lee 's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
Seems as funny 
Will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination . 
The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
Suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
It tight and nasty 
Enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls 
( dong ) makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
Is as padded as allen 's jelly belly 
A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows 
Impossible to claim that it is `` based on a true story ''

As refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream .

The problem with the bread , my sweet is that it 's far too sentimental . 
Fantastic dual performance 
Beautifully sung

The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' 
That years and years of costly analysis could never fix 
... fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist 's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film . 
To show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn

Barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other .

Graphic sex may be what 's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake 
That rare family movie -- genuine and sweet 
Ridiculous wig

To overcome my resistance 
Near-masterpiece

It 's better than the phantom menace . 
The connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , 
Crypt 
Likely to leave a lasting impression 
Its rather routine script 
This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom . 
Goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults 
And intermittently hilarious 
For this story to go but down 
Like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock . 
, the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
Of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum 
Ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic 
To be somebody , and to belong to somebody 
The film is a pleasant enough dish . 
Flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , 
To be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable 
Joyless 
The intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country 
Certainly wo n't be remembered as one of ( witherspoon 's ) better films . 
Best korean film 
Should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
Drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
Is silly beyond comprehension 
The movie could be released in this condition 
`` the dangerous lives of altar boys '' has flaws , but 
A buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we 're all in this together 
By supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil 
An overwhelmingly positive portrayal 
To make its subject interesting to those who are n't part of its supposed target audience 
A real filmmaker 's eye 
This makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture 
Rap and r&b names 
Brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema 
Great performances

That 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school

Sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip 
What is missing from it 
Plotting 
Has a film used manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
That worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz 
Prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design 
Of crudup 's anchoring performance 
One that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another 
Goofiness 
But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
The second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
Moving and solidly entertaining 
It still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
That never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
Is well crafted , and well executed . 
Resurrection 
Different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches 
Decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
After another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults 
The best , 
Involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film 
All of dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , 
Found in almost all of his previous works 
Truly excellent 
Director to watch 
Sharp and quick 
Orgy 
Warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it 
The magnificent jackie chan 
Collapses 
, vapid and devoid 
By a plot that 's just too boring and obvious 
Complain 
Winning performances 
Its love of life and beauty 
Soulless and -- even more damning -- 
Cold fish 
A degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing 
The the wisdom and humor of its subjects 
The town has kind of an authentic feel 
Entirely believable 
That old adage about women being unknowable 
Have potential as a cult film 
Is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly 
Discomfort 
You never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again 
Totally overwrought , 
Sunny disposition 
Excellent use of music by india 's popular gulzar and jagjit singh 
Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
Awfulness 
Ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
Lax and limp 
Wisdom 
A paint-by-numbers picture 
Does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence 
Through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill 
I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign 
Nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film ... 
Is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone 
Is so resolutely 
Hilariously , gloriously alive , and 
Drawn-out 
True to its title 
Glory days 
And often contradictory 
A stereotype 
Puts a human face 
Every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat 
, then by all means check it out . 
While parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville 's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast ... have made the old boy 's characters more quick-witted than any english lit 
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
Too thin 
Sitting in a downtown caf�� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and 
Wondering what all that jazz was about `` chicago '' in 2002 
As a tribute 
A brilliant college student -- where 's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
Of the conflict that came to define a generation 
Richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
Will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act 
Bump in the night and nobody 
Has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores . 
This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... 
, the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
That are quite touching 
I liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed . 
Graceless 
That annoying specimen 
Two central performances 
' hanging over the film 
It takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy

Affluence 
Really , save your disgust and your indifference 
Five screenwriters are credited with the clich��-laden screenplay 
Joyous 
Gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
Then blood work is for you . 
, frida gets the job done . 
The class warfare 
Against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
A transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years 
May rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season 
Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle . 
Lacks in eye-popping visuals 
Ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity 
An equally miserable film 
Its heartfelt concern about north korea 's recent past and south korea 's future 
So pat it makes your teeth hurt 
A delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
Splash 
Of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness 
Both the scenic splendor 
I saw it as a young boy 
Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : 
You may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . 
A chilling tale of one of the great crimes 
Starts out 
The situation in a well-balanced fashion 
Which was shot two years ago 
Becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities 
Will keep coming 
You 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous ( than leon ) . 
Proves that director m. night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo .

Master class .

A fine-looking film with a bouncy score 
Promisingly 
The entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
Weirdo actor crispin glover 
Takes its title all too literally . 
Is loopy and ludicrous ... 
Threatens 
There , done that 
Who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents 
What makes the movie special 
The action looks fake 
Blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period . 
Maintaining consciousness just long enough 
Difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
Is so fascinating that you wo n't care . 
Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 
Does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre 
A better movie 
Monotone 
Faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance 
's always enthralling . 
, another gross-out college comedy -- ugh . 
Affirms 
Gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
Formuliac , but fun . 
A quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 . 
To hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago 
Well-done 
Fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew 
Dialogue and likeable characters 
Part biography , part entertainment and part history 
, the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
A rather dull , unimaginative car chase 
Is nothing short of a great one . 
A supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life 
Is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater 
90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation 
Comedy ensemble 
Throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` look at this ! 
Brilliant movie 
Too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience 
's stuffy and pretentious 
Polished , 
Works more often than it does n't . 
At least passably 
I also believe that resident evil is not it . 
Seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other 
Showing off his doctorate 
A delightful comedy 
Anguish , anger and frustration 
At achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself 
A patient viewer
